  <h1>Christ Presbyterian Church</h1>
  
  <p>
    Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven is a member of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one of many communions in the church universal, the PCA may be distinguished by its affirmation of what has been described as the "Reformed system of faith" as reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith. The PCA is characterized by its emphasis on both personal revival and theological reformation. Without revival, reformation can become "dead orthodoxy." Without reformation, revival can result in shallow experientialism and misinformed zeal. By promoting reformation and revival, we seek to carry out the Great Commission with Biblical integrity and personal authenticity unto the glory of God.

  <h2>Five Basic Commitments</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3 id="heading1">We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures</h3>
      <p>
        While believing that God powerfully manifests His infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice are grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. We believe also that all special revelation has ceased until the next and final redemptive act of God in history when Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, recognizing no other source for divine revelation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 id="heading2">We are committed to the teachings of grace</h3>
      <p>
        Whereas the Holy Scriptures are our only rule of faith and practice, our Church unity is predicated upon a consensus about what the Scriptures principally teach. Our consensus is reflected in the 350-year-old Westminster Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that we are accepted by God, from beginning to end, not by our own works or attempts at being approved by God, but by faith alone in the perfect and all-sufficient work of Christ on our behalf, faith itself being the free gift of God!
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To affirm the sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women who have gone before us, and to prevent our historical and cultural blind spots.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 id="heading3">We are committed to God-centered worship</h3>
      <p>
        Our worship is set to the pattern of covenant initiation and renewal, including the weekly participation of the Lord's Supper. Our music and style of worship are "blended" to reflect the vernacular context of those God has brought to our city. Our desire is for our worship to be as God-centered as our theology, communicating the truth and grace of God to the nations. We welcome all believers together with those who are searching.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Not only is it biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel every week, secured upon Christ's redemption accomplished. Our worship embodies the gospel as we experience God's presence.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 id="heading4">We are committed to being a multi-cultural church and church planting movement</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that the church, the household of God, is an essential element of the gospel into which people of every tribe and nation are welcomed. It is, therefore, our ambition to be not only a growing church but also a growing church planting movement. Our aim is to plant churches that reach the different cultures in our city, New England, and the world.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because no one culture is closer to God than another, you don't have to become American (or Western, or whatever!) to become Christian, and the corporate witness of the gospel is the best testament to its power!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 id="heading5">We are committed to a high view of Christian calling</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that God has placed into our lives the boundaries of our habitation that reflect His own sovereign design to accomplish His work in the world. His work extends into the spheres of family, church, and civil vocations. Our ultimate commitment is to the restoration of "calling" that we might more and more glorify God and enjoy Him forever!
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because God didn't make us just one way or with one part of ourselves, but made ALL of us, and He deserves it all to be offered as a thank offering.</p>
    </li>
