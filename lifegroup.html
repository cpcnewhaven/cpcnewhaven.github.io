                <p>"God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together."
                    - 1 Corinthians 12:24-26</p>
                <p>God's people are the hands and feet of Christ. We cannot
                    experience God and grow spiritually in a truly
                    gospel-centered and biblical way if we are living in
                    isolation. Neither can we say we are flourishing if our
                    brother or sister in Christ is suffering. Bound together
                    with covenant communion, God brings us into new
                    relationships where sacrifice is freedom and giving to
                    others is where we find life.</p>

                <p>Life Groups are our way of doing church in the small with all
                    sorts of people engaged in prayer, teaching, fellowship and
                    care. They are the vehicle that we use to help its
                    participants continue to experience Christ outside of our
                    worship gatherings and to impart the pastoral care that
                    Christ provides through the love of His people. Thus, the
                    worship, teaching, fellowship, and care for one another
                    supply a more intimate and hands-on encounter with the
                    living Christ.</p>

                <h2>Discipleship Groups</h2>
                <h3>SMALL GROUPS</h3>

                <p>Christian discipleship is the application of the gospel to
                    every aspect of life. The very gospel that sets us free from
                    the fear of divine and human condemnation is the same power
                    that transforms our relationships, work, and worship.
                    Biblical discipleship, including word, worship, and
                    fellowship, exists at CPC primarily through Sunday worship,
                    courses offered through the School of Discipleship, and
                    Men’s and Women’s Discipleship Groups.</p>
                <p>We encourage all congregation members to participate in both
                    a Life Group and a Discipleship Group. Although there are
                    components of study in each Discipleship Group, their focus
                    is on living and sharing truth through mutual
                    accountability, study, and prayer.</p>
