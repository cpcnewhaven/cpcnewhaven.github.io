                <p>Throughout history, special relationships have been set apart
                    by the taking of vows. What exactly is a vow? A vow is a
                    “confession” regarding the meaning of ones participation in
                    a given institution. Therefore, vows are ordinarily limited
                    to initiation ceremonies. And according to the Bible, there
                    are three such institutions that enjoy a divine
                    sanction--the church, the state and the family. For
                    instance, vows are used to initiate a judicial proceeding or
                    even citizenship in the civil sphere. Vows are used to
                    initiate a family relationship between a husband and wife in
                    the family sphere. And, for those who believe that the
                    church is a third institution set apart by God, vows are
                    used to initiate a church relationship, or perhaps one’s
                    service in an office of the church. And would it surprise
                    you that every one of the above examples can be located in
                    the Bible? We will review briefly the biblical rationale
                    that relates to the taking of vows in the church sphere.</p>
                <p>According to the apostle Paul, one becomes a Christian when
                    “you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe
                    in your heart that God raised him from the dead” (Romans
                    10:9). Who are we “confessing” to with our lips and in what
                    context? Related to this, what else could it mean for the
                    elders to “watch over the flock of God” if not a flock that
                    can be defined by some “initiation” ceremony in relation to
                    the exchange of vows? Or, in the words of Hebrews, what else
                    could it mean to “obey your leaders and submit to them, for
                    they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an
                    account,” apart from some willing and voluntary way to form
                    an association that is predicated upon the taking of vows
                    one to another? (see 1 Peter 5, Hebrews 13:17). And when the
                    church is exhorted to “remove such a one” from “the
                    assembly” as the ultimate, albeit tragic, expression of
                    church discipline, what else could it mean except that the
                    person was joined to the assembly by some confession that is
                    later deemed broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5). Or, when we are
                    exhorted to support one another even through our financial
                    means, how could such benefits be distributed except that it
                    means something to bind one’s self to another through the
                    authenticating protections of an initiation ceremony? (2
                    Corinthians 8).</p>
                <p>And so, for these abbreviated reasons, we believe that church
                    membership as a good thing. It sets people apart into a
                    special relationship with each other, where the terms are
                    clear and where loyalties for the mutual benefit of all are
                    expressed and preserved. Membership is simply a way to say:
                    “I confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to enjoy
                    the mutual support of one another until, for whatever
                    reason, someone is led elsewhere.”</p>
