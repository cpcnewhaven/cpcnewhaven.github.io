## About
### Our Total Christ Spirituality
Everyone is truly welcomed into God's presence because there is no limit to God's grace as accomplished for us by Christ. No matter who you are or where you've been, CPC hopes to be a community where you can discover the transforming power of the gospel. Everything we do - from Sunday worship to small groups, fellowship meals, and loving service - seeks to be grounded in the good news. Though we may be more sinful than we're even willing to imagine, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. Please join us as we hope to be one example of the presence of the Holy Spirit in and for New Haven.

## Youth
### Our Total Christ Spirituality
We want this to be all about Christâ€”his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ.

The term "Total Christ" originates from the 5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as "the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body."

## The Five Marks
1. **Gospel-Centered**: Trust in the gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin because it's based in God's power! Everything we do is motivated from and by the gospel.
2. **Missional**: More (though not less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages, and demographics through the church.
3. **Confessional - Christ as our Prophet**: We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across generations and cultures.
4. **Sacramental - Christ as our Priest**: We desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein Christ our Priest is "fleshed out" in a carefully designed four-movement worship service.
5. **Communal - Christ as our King**: Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community.

## Our Commitments
We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope.

### Our Five Basic Commitments
1. **Scripture**: We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice.
2. **Teachings of Grace**: We are committed to the teachings of grace as they are summarized in the historic Westminster Confession of Faith.
3. **God-Centered Worship**: We are committed to God-centered worship designed after a covenantal pattern, where Christ promises to be present through Word and Sacrament.
4. **Multi-Cultural Church and Church Planting**: We are committed to being a multi-cultural church and church planting movement.
5. **High View of Christian Calling**: We are committed to a high view of Christian calling as reflected in the vocational spheres of family, church, and public service.
