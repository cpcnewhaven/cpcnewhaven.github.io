                        community, we talk a lot about making this a
                        "safe place" for real-time sinful people to be in
                        journey with Christ. There is no limit to God's grace as
                        accomplished for us by Christ. And aspiring to not just
                        learn about Christ and the good news of the gospel we
                        talk a lot about participating in Christ's presence. We
                        do this both in the mystery of "one-anothering" in the
                        power of the Holy Spirit, and in the mystery of
                        sacramental worship wherein we "do" the gospel in the
                        ancient temple pattern of four movements. Through it
                        all, Christ is in the midst of us by the Holy Spirit as
                        our prophet, priest and king! So I hope you will join us

                    believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever

                    bleeds into how we treat each other inside and outside
                    of the church. Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian -
                    or even Christian - so please feel comfortable coming

                    knows we are all in need of God's mercy, and have the
                    privilege to embody it in the church.

                <p class="body-text">Our Commitments
                    Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven is a member of the
                    Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one of many
                    communions
                    in the church universal, the PCA may be distinguished by its
                    affirmation of what has been described as the
                    "Reformed system of faith" as reflected in the Westminster
                    Confession of Faith. The PCA is characterized by its
                    emphasis on
                    both personal revival and theological reformation. By
                    promoting
                    reformation and revival, we seek to carry out the Great
                    Commission with Biblical integrity and personal authenticity
                    unto the glory of God.</p>
                <p class="body-text"><b>1.</b><strong>We are committed to the
                        Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of
                        faith and practice. </strong> While believing that God
                    powerfully manifests his infinite glory in a general way
                    through creation, our Christian faith and practice is
                    grounded in God's works of redemption in history as
                    explained to us through the divinely appointed means of
                    inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for
                    salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit
                    speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New
                    Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the
                    whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting
                    from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other
                    source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical
                    traditions or private revelations.
                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all
                    of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the
                    gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving
                    abuses.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>2.</b><strong>We are committed to the
                        teachings of grace as they are summarized in the
                        historic Westminster Confession of Faith.
                    </strong>Whereas the Holy Scriptures is our only rule of
                    faith and practice, Church unity is predicated upon a
                    consensus about what the Scriptures principally teach. Our
                    consensus is reflected in the 350-year--old Westminster
                    Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that God is no
                    less sovereign in our salvation than He is sovereign in our
                    creation, to the praise of God's glorious grace! This means
                    that we are accepted by God, from beginning to end, not by
                    our own works or attempts at being approved by God, but by
                    faith alone in the perfect and all sufficient work of Christ
                    on our behalf, faith itself being the free gift of God!
                    While many people join our church without knowing or
                    affirming all the teachings contained in the Westminster
                    Confession of Faith, our church, when acting and speaking
                    corporately, seeks to be in accord with the Westminster
                    Standards.
                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To affirm the
                    sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women
                    who have gone before us, and to prevent as much as possible
                    our historical and cultural blind-spots.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>3.</b><strong>We are committed to
                        God-centered worship designed after a covenantal
                        pattern, where Christ promises to be present through
                        Word and sacrament. </strong>In every period of
                    redemptive history, God has chosen to mediate his saving
                    presence among his people as regulated through the divine
                    institutions of word, sacrament and prayers. Today, through
                    the sacraments of the Lord's Supper and Christian Baptism,
                    together with the preaching of God's word and corporate
                    prayers (both sung and unsung), God has promised to be with
                    us until the end of the age. Our worship is set to the
                    pattern of covenant initiation and renewal including the
                    weekly participation of the Lord's supper. Our music and
                    style of worship is "blended" to reflect the vernacular
                    context of those God has brought to our city. Our desire is
                    for our worship to be as God-centered as our theology,
                    communicating the truth and grace of God to the nations. We
                    welcome all believers together with those who are searching.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Not only is it
                    biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel every week,
                    secured upon Christ's redemption accomplished. Our worship
                    embodies the gospel as we experience God's presence.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>4.</b><strong>We are committed to being
                        a multi-cultural church and church planting movement.
                    </strong> We believe that the church, the household of God,
                    is an essential element of the gospel into which people of
                    every tribe and nation are welcomed. While affirming that
                    every follower of Christ is called to be a witness to the
                    truth and grace of God revealed in Jesus Christ, we also
                    believe that true evangelism is best accomplished through
                    church planting. It is therefore our ambition to be not only
                    a growing church, but also a growing church planting
                    movement. While holding to a time-honored understanding of
                    faith, we are strategically progressive. Our aim is to plant
                    churches that reach the different cultures in our city, New
                    England and the world.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because no one
                    culture is closer to God than another, you don't have to
                    become American (or Western, or whatever!) to become
                    Christian, and the communal witness of the gospel is the
                    best testament to its power!</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>5.</b><strong>We are committed to a high
                        view of Christian calling as reflected in the vocational
                        spheres of family, church, and public service.
                    </strong>We believe that God has given us roles that reflect
                    his own sovereign design to accomplish his work in the
                    world, which extends into the spheres of family, church and
                    civil vocations. We desire to help people find a balance
                    that is unique to their individual callings and spheres of
                    service. While believing that the Christian Scriptures does
                    not address all things pertaining to life in this world, we
                    do affirm that we should take
                    "every thought captive to the obedience of Christ" and that
                    the Christian worldview is applicable and relevant to all
                    spheres of life.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because God
                    didn't make us just one way or with one part of ourselves,
                    but made ALL of us, and he deserves it all to be offered as
                    a thank offering.</p>

                <p class="body-text">You will see it all throughout our
                    literature and printed on our bulletin covers—"that Christ
                    might come to be first in everything" (Col.1:18-19). Yes,
                    our name Christ Presbyterian Church really means that we
                    want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the
                    basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his
                    glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our
                    ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to
                    experience total Christ not just one or another brand of
                    Christ which would focus on one or another aspect of
                    Christ's ministry in our lives.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    The term "Total Christ" originates from the 5th century
                    pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the
                    relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to
                    his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as "the Word was
                    made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined
                    the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and
                    body." It is our intention to reunite these spiritualities
                    that in modern history tend to be separated. These churches
                    place heavy emphasis on both the grace of the gospel and the
                    importance of the church as the locus of missions. They do
                    not dichotomize teaching and community, but instead seek to
                    show forth Christ's life-giving presence as these things are
                    lived out in a particular community. We believe that
                    gospel-centered and missional are as inseparable as Christ's
                    head (Word) is to Christ's body (temple)! [cf. Jn 1:14, Eph
                    1:22-23] Such churches seek to mediate Christ's vivifying
                    presence as our Prophet (through confessional teaching),
                    Priest (through sacramental worship) and King (through
                    communal formation).

                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Our search then is the search for Christ wherein it can be
                    hopefully said that he is "head over all things to the
                    church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all
                    in all" (Eph.1:22-23, also 2:19ff). In search of a holistic
                    and healthy Christian life and church, the five marks of a
                    "total Christ" spirituality are as follows:

                </p>
                <h3>The Five Marks</h3>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>GOSPEL-CENTERED:</strong> We believe that the Gospel
                    is not only the ABC's but the A to Z's of the Christian life
                    in at least two ways. First, it is not only our ticket to
                    heaven based on grace through faith, it is the way God sets
                    us free to live the more transformed life. Second, the
                    Gospel is not just about the "inward" person concerning our
                    spiritual needs, but also the "outward" person concerned
                    with our emotional, physical, vocational, etc. needs. The
                    Gospel therefore is a holistic commitment to empowerment
                    aimed at spiritual conversion and discipleship in reliance
                    upon Christ together with micro-enterprise ventures and
                    family/personal Christian counseling. (Rom.1:17, Eph
                    2:1-10)!
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>BEING MISSIONAL: </strong> More than a source of
                    mission, the carefully designed, apostolically-organized,
                    church is the locus of mission and the very life giving and
                    mediated presence of Christ. Just the church being the
                    church with the whole world present is God's missionary
                    strategy to the world (John 1:14, 20:21)! This makes our
                    approach to evangelism and discipleship participatory and
                    not simply declarative.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>UNITED IN BELIEF:</strong> Whereas the Scripture is
                    our only rule of faith and practice, we want to read and
                    interpret the scripture with the consensus of the church
                    that is passed down from every age and place through the use
                    of "confessions". Our consensus is reflected in the
                    Westminster Confession of Faith which is consistent with
                    other familiar creeds such as the Apostles' and Nicene
                    creeds. We strive to apply our beliefs to all of life and in
                    so doing relate to Dorothy Sayers' famous saying "the dogma
                    is the drama!"
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>PARTICIPATING IN SACRAMENTAL WORSHIP:</strong> We
                    desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein
                    Christ our Priest is "fleshed out" in a carefully designed
                    four movement worship service that follows the four
                    movements of the gospel and culminates every week in a
                    participation in eucharistic communion with Christ as
                    "fleshed out" in cultural styles specific to each local
                    community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)!
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>UNITED IN COMMUNITY: </strong> We want to emphasize
                    a local-oriented ministry where community really matters.
                    This community formation occurs where Christ our King is
                    fleshed out through life on life "one anothering" and
                    holistic empowerment under the shepherding care of Christ's
                    under-shepherds and servant leaders. (Jn 13:34, Gal. 6:2, 1
                    Peter 5:1-5)!<br><br>
                    What to look for in each aspect of our spirituality includes
                    the experience of Christian assurance, an identity-oriented
                    approach to faith, transparency in confession, a different
                    approach to suffering, a new motivation for service, freedom
                    from self-promotion, a love for the law as a basis for
                    flourishing, Sabbath enjoyment, a participatory approach to
                    evangelism, a high regard for scripture, communal reading of
                    the Bible, a culture of humble submission to scripture,
                    sacramental worship, and a communal approach to life and
                    ministry.

                    Mission Anabaino (MA) is mission "I am ascending" (the
                    meaning of the Greek word "anabaino" which is used in John
                    20:17). It seeks to fulfill the "greater things" in relation
                    to Christ's great expectations regarding his ascension
                    ministry today (John 14:12). In practical terms, it is to
                    participate in the real and personal advent of Christ
                    through church planting and the ecumenically oriented
                    rediscovery of missional ecclesiology. More than a
                    philosophy of ministry, Mission Anabaino is a theological
                    vision rooted in the simplicity and purity of devotion to
                    Christ and his continued salvific presence today applied to
                    mission!
