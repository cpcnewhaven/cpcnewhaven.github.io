                    <h2>What to expect</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aspiring to be a gospel centered community, we talk a
                        lot about making this a "safe place" for real-time
                        sinful people to be in journey with Christ. There is no
                        limit to God's grace as accomplished for us by Christ.
                        And aspiring to not just learn about Christ and the good
                        news of the gospel we talk a lot about participating in
                        Christ's presence. We do this both in the mystery of
                        "one-anothering" in the power of the Holy Spirit, and in
                        the mystery of sacramental worship wherein we "do" the
                        gospel in the ancient temple pattern of four movements.
                        Through it all, Christ is in the midst of us by the Holy
                        Spirit as our prophet, priest and king! So I hope you
                        will join us and enjoy our journey together in Christ."

                <h2>About Membership</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout history, special relationships have been set
                    apart by the taking of vows. What exactly is a vow? A vow is
                    a “confession” regarding the meaning of one's participation
                    in a given institution. Therefore, vows are ordinarily
                    limited to initiation ceremonies. And according to the
                    Bible, there are three such institutions that enjoy divine
                    sanction--the church, the state, and the family. Vows are
                    used to initiate a church relationship, or perhaps one’s
                    service in an office of the church. We will review briefly
                    the biblical rationale that relates to the taking of vows in
                    the church sphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the apostle Paul, one becomes a Christian when
                    “you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe
                    in your heart that God raised him from the dead” (Romans
                    10:9). Who are we “confessing” to with our lips and in what
                    context? Related to this, what else could it mean for the
                    elders to “watch over the flock of God” if not a flock that
                    can be defined by some “initiation” ceremony in relation to
                    the exchange of vows? Or, in the words of Hebrews, what else
                    could it mean to “obey your leaders and submit to them, for
                    they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an
                    account,” apart from some willing and voluntary way to form
                    an association that is predicated upon the taking of vows
                    one to another? (see 1 Peter 5, Hebrews 13:17). And when the
                    church is exhorted to “remove such a one” from “the
                    assembly” as the ultimate, albeit tragic, expression of
                    church discipline, what else could it mean except that the
                    person was joined to the assembly by some con- fession that
                    is later deemed broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5). Or, when we
                    are exhorted to support one another even through our
                    financial means, how could such benefits be distributed
                    except that it means something to bind one’s self to another
                    through the authenticating protections of an initiation
                    ceremony? (2 Corinthians 8).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so, for these abbreviated reasons, we believe that
                    church membership as a good thing. It sets people apart into
                    a special relationship with each other, where the terms are
                    clear and where loyalties for the mutual benefit of all are
                    expressed and preserved. Membership is simply a way to say:
                    “I confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to enjoy
                    the mutual support of one another until, for whatever
                    reason, someone is led elsewhere.”

                    Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven is a member of the
                    Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one of many
                    communions in the church universal, the PCA may be
                    distinguished by its affirmation of what has been described
                    as the "Reformed system of faith" as reflected in the
                    Westminster Confession of Faith. The PCA is characterized by
                    its emphasis on both personal revival and theological
                    reformation. By promoting reformation and revival, we seek
                    to carry out the Great Commission with Biblical integrity
                    and personal authenticity unto the glory of God.

                <h3>Five Basic Commitments</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>We are committed to the Old and New Testament
                            Scriptures as our only rule of faith and
                            practice.</strong>
                        <p>
                            We are committed to the Old and New Testament
                            Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice.
                            While believing that God powerfully manifest his
                            infinite glory in a general way through creation,
                            our Christian faith and practice is grounded in
                            God's works of redemption in history as explained to
                            us through the divinely appointed means of inspired
                            Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for
                            salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the
                            Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the
                            Old and New Testaments. We believe also that all
                            special revelation has ceased until the next and
                            final redemptive act of God in history when Christ
                            will return to judge the living and the dead. It is,
                            therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel
                            of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting from,
                            anything contained within it, recognizing no other
                            source for divine revelation, whether by
                            ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all
                            of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard
                            the gracious gospel against manipulation and
                            self-serving abuses.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>We are committed to the teachings of grace as
                            they are summarized in the historic Westminster
                            Confession of Faith.</strong>
                        <p>
                            We are committed to the teachings of grace as they
                            are summarized in the historic Westminster
                            Confession of Faith. Whereas the Holy Scriptures is
                            our only rule of faith and practice, our Church
                            unity is predicated upon a consensus about what the
                            Scriptures principally teach. Our consensus is
                            reflected in the 350-year--old Westminster
                            Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that God
                            is no less sovereign in our salvation than He is
                            sovereign in our creation to the praise of God's
                            glorious grace! This means that we are accepted by
                            God, from beginning to end, not by our own works or
                            attempts at being approved by God, but by faith
                            alone in the perfect and all sufficient work of
                            Christ on our behalf, faith itself being the free
                            gift of God! While many people join our church
                            without knowing or affirming all the teachings
                            contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith,
                            our church, when acting and speaking corporately,
                            seeks to be in accord with the Westminster
                            Standards.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To affirm the
                            sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and
                            women who have gone before us, and to prevent as
                            much as possible our historical and cultural
                            blind-spots.</p>

                        <strong>We are committed to God-centered worship

                            mediated presence of Christ through word and
                            sacrament.</strong>
                        <p>
                            We are committed to God-centered worship designed
                            after a covenantal pattern that is in the mediated
                            presence of Christ through word and sacrament. In
                            every period of redemptive history, God has chosen
                            to mediate his saving presence among his people as
                            regulated through the divine institutions of word,
                            sacrament and prayers. Today, through the sacraments
                            of the Lord's Supper and Christian Baptism, together
                            with the preaching of God's word and corporate
                            prayers (both sung and unsung), God has promised to
                            be with us until the end of the age. Our worship is
                            set to the pattern of covenant initiation and
                            renewal including the weekly participation of the
                            Lord's supper. Our music and style of worship is
                            "blended" to reflect the vernacular context of those
                            God has brought to our city. Our desire is for our
                            worship to be as God-centered as our theology,
                            communicating the truth and grace of God to the
                            nations. We welcome all believers together with
                            those who are searching.

                            biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel
                            every week, secured upon Christ's redemption
                            accomplished. Our worship embodies the gospel as we

                            church, the household of God, is an essential
                            element of the gospel into which people of every
                            tribe and nation are welcomed. While affirming that
                            every follower of Christ is called to be a witness
                            to the truth and grace of God revealed in Jesus
                            Christ in both word and deed, we also believe that
                            true evangelism is best accomplished through church
                            planting. It is therefore our ambition to be not
                            only a growing church, but also a growing church
                            planting movement. While holding to a time-honored
                            understanding of faith, we are strategically
                            progressive. Our aim is to plant churches that reach
                            the different cultures in our city, New England and
                            the world.

                        <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because no one
                            culture is closer to God than another, you don't
                            have to become American (or Western, or whatever!)
                            to become Christian, and the corporate witness of
                            the gospel is the best testament to its power!</p>

                        <p>
                            We are committed to a high view of Christian calling
                            as reflected in the vocational spheres of family,
                            church and public service. We believe that God has
                            placed into our lives the boundaries of our
                            habitation that reflect his own sovereign design to
                            accomplish his work in the world. His work extends
                            into the spheres of family, church and civil
                            vocations. We desire to help people find a balance
                            that is unique to their individual callings which
                            reflects a high view of vocation and calling in
                            these three spheres of service. While believing that
                            the Christian Scriptures does not address all things
                            pertaining to life in this world, we do affirm that
                            we should take
                            "every thought captive to the obedience of Christ"
                            and that the Christian worldview is applicable and
                            relevant to all spheres of life. Our ultimate
                            commitment is to the restoration of "calling" that
                            we might more and more glorify God and enjoy Him
                            forever!
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because God
                            didn't make us just one way or with one part of
                            ourselves, but made ALL of us, and he deserves it
                            all to be offered as a thank offering.</p>

                <h2>Our Search For Total Christ Spirituality</h2>
                <p>
                    You will see it all throughout our literature and printed on
                    our bulletin covers—“that Christ might come to be first in
                    everything” (Col.1:18-19). Yes, our name Christ Presbyterian
                    Church really means that we want this to be all about
                    Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship
                    to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any
                    popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and
                    respect. But it needs to go beyond even this! It is our
                    desire to experience total Christ not just one or another
                    brand of Christ which would focus on one or another aspect
                    of Christ’s ministry in our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term “Total Christ” originates from the 5th century
                    pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the
                    relationship of Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to
                    his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as “the Word was
                    made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined
                    the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and
                    body.” It is our intention to reunite these spiritualities
                    that in modern history tend to be separated. These churches
                    place heavy emphasis on both the grace of the gospel and the
                    importance of the church as the locus of missions. They do
                    not dichotomize teaching and community, but instead seek to
                    show forth Christ’s life giving presence as these things are
                    lived out in a particular community. We believe that
                    gospel-centered and missional are as inseparable as Christ’s
                    head (Word) is to Christ’s body (temple)! [cf. Jn 1:14, Eph
                    1:22-23] Such churches seek to mediate Christ’s vivifying
                    presence as our Prophet (through confessional teaching),
                    Priest (through sacramental worship) and King (through
                    communal formation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our search then is the search for Christ wherein it can be
                    hopefully said that he is a “head over all things to the
                    church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all
                    in all” (Eph.1:22-23, also 2:19ff). In search of a holistic
                    and healthy Christian life and church, the five marks of a
                    "total Christ" spirituality are as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>GOSPEL-CENTERED:</strong> We believe that the
                        Gospel is not only the ABC’s but the A to Z’s of the
                        Christian life in at least two ways. First, it is not
                        only our ticket to heaven based on grace through faith,
                        it is the way God sets us free to live the more
                        transformed life. Second, the Gospel is not just about
                        the “inward” person concerning our spiritual needs, but
                        also the “outward” person concerned with our emotional,
                        physical, vocational, etc. needs. The Gospel therefore
                        is a holistic commitment to empowerment aimed at
                        spiritual conversion and discipleship in reliance upon
                        Christ together with micro-enterprise ventures and
                        family/personal Christian counseling. (Rom.1:17, Eph
                        2:1-10)!</li>
                    <li><strong>BEING MISSIONAL:</strong> More than a source of
                        mission, the carefully designed,
                        apostolically-organized, church is the locus of mission
                        and the very life giving and mediated presence of
                        Christ. Just the church being the church with the whole
                        world present is God’s missionary strategy to the world
                        (John 1:14, 20:21)! This makes our approach to
                        evangelism and discipleship participatory and not simply
                        declarative.</li>
                    <li><strong>UNITED IN BELIEF:</strong> Whereas the Scripture
                        is our only rule of faith and practice, we want to read
                        and interpret the scripture with the consensus of the
                        church that is passed down from every age and place
                        through the use of “confessions”. Our consensus is
                        reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith which
                        is consistent with other familiar creeds such as the
                        Apostles' and Nicene creeds. We strive to apply our
                        beliefs to all of life and in so doing relate to Dorothy
                        Sayers’ famous saying “the dogma is the drama!”</li>
                    <li><strong>PARTICIPATING IN SACRAMENTAL WORSHIP:</strong>
                        We desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality
                        wherein Christ our Priest is “fleshed out” in a
                        carefully designed four movement worship service that
                        follows the four movements of the gospel and culminates
                        every week in a participation in eucharistic communion
                        with Christ as “fleshed out” in cultural styles specific
                        to each local community ecific to each local community
                        (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)!</li>
                    <li><strong>UNITED IN COMMUNITY:</strong> We want to
                        emphasize a local-oriented ministry where community
                        really matters. This community formation occurs where
                        Christ our King is fleshed out through life on life “one
                        anothering” and holistic empowerment under the
                        shepherding care of Christ’s under-shepherds and servant
                        leaders. (Jn 13:34, Gal. 6:2, 1 Peter 5:1-5)!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    What to look for in each aspect of our spirituality includes
                    the experience of Christian assurance, an identity-oriented
                    approach to faith, transparency in confession, a different
                    approach to suffering, a new motivation for service, freedom
                    from self-promotion, a love for the law as a basis for
                    flourishing, Sabbath enjoyment, a participatory approach to
                    evangelism, a high regard for scripture, communal reading of
                    the Bible, a culture of humble submission to scripture,
                    sacramental worship, and a communal approach to life and
                    ministry.

                <h2>Mission Anabaino (MA)</h2>
                <p>
                    Mission Anabaino (MA) is mission “I am ascending” (the
                    meaning of the Greek word “anabaino” which is used in John
                    20:17). It seeks to fulfill the “greater things” in relation
                    to Christ’s great expectations regarding his ascension
                    ministry today (John 14:12). In practical terms, it is to
                    participate in the real and personal advent of Christ
                    through church planting and the ecumenically oriented
                    rediscovery of missional ecclesiology. More than a
                    philosophy of ministry, Mission Anabaino is a theological
                    vision rooted in the simplicity and purity of devotion to
                    Christ and his continued salvific presence today applied to
                    mission!
                </p>
                <h3>Our Theological Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to plant what we call Total Christ churches.
                    Fifth century pastor-theologian St. Augustine originated the
                    term “Total Christ” when describing the relationship of
                    Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing
                    ascension ministry (present) as “the Word was made flesh,
                    and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church,
                    and there is made total Christ, both head and body” (John
                    1:14 and Ephesians 1:21-23, 2:19ff). Employing the
                    Chalcedonian formula of “distinct but never separate” of
                    christology to ecclesiology, Augustine further explained:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Then let us rejoice and give thanks that we are made not only Christians, but Christ. Do you understand, brothers, and apprehend the grace of God upon us? Marvel, be glad, we are made Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members: the whole man is he and we . . . The fullness of Christ, then, is head and members. Head and members, what is that? Christ and the Church!"
                    (St. Augustine, Homilies on the Gospel of John)
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Acknowledging and even celebrating the mystery in all of
                    this, it is our intention to reunite these spiritualities
                    that in modern history tend to be separated — what could be
                    described as a “covenant” theology (gospel centered) and a
                    “temple” theology (church centered) of salvation and the
                    gospel. If one stresses the regulative and declarative
                    nature of mission, the other stresses the participational
                    and presence nature of mission – both informed by grace and
                    both at the same time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Total Christ vision believes that a church cannot separate
                    being gospel-centered from being missional any more than
                    Christ’s head (Word) can be separated from Christ’s body
                    (temple)! Such churches seek to mediate Christ’s vivifying
                    presence as our Prophet (through confessional teaching),
                    Priest (through sacramental worship), and King (through
                    communal formation). In so doing, a Total Christ vision will
                    want to reunite what has too often been presented as an
                    “either-or” (dichotomized) vision for ministry and mission
                    in recent church history.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Our strategy simply stated is 10-10-10, that is to plant:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ten Congregations Locally</li>
                    <li>Ten Church Planting Movements Globally</li>
                    <li>In Ten Years</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Locally, we have begun planting congregations in the greater
                    New Haven area that reflect the different voices and
                    locations of our diverse city. Until a Total Christ vision
                    of the gospel is made geographically and/or culturally
                    accessible to each citizen, we will not be finished
                    planting. Globally, in conjunction with our growing MA
                    community and affiliate network we have begun church
                    planting movements around the world that can themselves
                    continue church planting. Currently, our multiple
                    congregations are already a reflection of one church
                    organically united in beliefs, mission, and a cooperative
                    strategy expressed in a kind of symphonic multiplicity of
                    cultural voices and instruments. We are presently
                    considering many additional opportunities such as in global
                    center cities, college towns, and other major world contexts
