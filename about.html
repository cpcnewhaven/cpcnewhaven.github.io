                        Everything we do - from Sunday worship to small groups,
                        fellowship meals, and loving service - seeks to be

                    We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that
                    though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe,
                    we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A
                    community united in the love of Jesus changes lives and
                    communities. We hope that Sunday worship is the touchstone
                    of our lives and that it bleeds into how we treat each other
                    inside and outside of the church. Many of us didn't grow up
                    Presbyterian - or even Christian - so please feel
                    comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to be a
                    community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and
                    have the privilege to embody it in the church.

                <h3>Our Five Basic Commitments</h3>

                <p class="body-text"><b>1.</b><strong> Scripture - We are
                        committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our
                        only rule of faith and practice. </strong> While
                    believing that God powerfully manifests his infinite glory
                    in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and
                    practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in history
                    as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of
                    inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for
                    salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit
                    speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New
                    Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the
                    whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting
                    from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other
                    source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical
                    traditions or private revelations.
                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all
                    of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the
                    gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving
                    abuses. We want the God of grace and glory to be our only
                    Lord.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>2.</b><strong>Teachings of Grace - We
                        are committed to the teachings of grace as they are
                        summarized in the historic Westminster Confession of
                        Faith.
                    </strong>Teachings of Grace - We are committed to the
                    teachings of grace as they are summarized in the historic
                    Westminster Confession of Faith. Whereas the Holy Scriptures
                    is our only rule of faith and practice, Church unity is
                    predicated upon a consensus about what the Scriptures
                    principally teach. Our consensus is reflected in the
                    350-year--old Westminster Confession of Faith. In summary,
                    it affirms that God is no less sovereign in our salvation
                    than He is sovereign in our creation, to the praise of God's
                    glorious grace! This means that we are accepted by God, from
                    beginning to end, not by our own works or attempts to
                    perform for God, but by faith alone in the perfect and all
                    sufficient work of Christ on our behalf, faith itself being
                    the free gift of God. While many people join our church
                    without knowing or affirming all the teachings contained in
                    the Westminster Confession of Faith, our church, when acting
                    and speaking corporately, seeks to be in accord with the
                    Westminster Standards.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To affirm the
                    sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women
                    who have gone before us, and to prevent as much as possible
                    our historical and cultural blind-spots.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>3.</b><strong> God-Centered Worship - We
                        are committed to God-centered worship designed after a
                        covenantal pattern, where Christ promises to be present
                        through Word and Sacrament.</strong> In every period of
                    redemptive history, God has chosen to be with his people
                    through the divine institutions of word, sacrament and
                    prayers. Today, through the sacraments of the Lord's Supper
                    and Christian Baptism, together with the preaching of God's
                    word and corporate prayers (both sung and unsung), God has
                    promised to be with us until the end of the age. Our worship
                    is set to the pattern of covenant initiation and renewal
                    including the weekly participation of the Lord's supper. Our
                    music and style of worship is "blended" to reflect the
                    vernacular context of those God has brought to our city. Our
                    desire is for our worship to be as God-centered as our
                    theology, communicating the truth and grace of God to the
                    nations. We welcome all believers together with those who
                    are searching.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong>Not only is it
                    biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel every week,
                    secured upon Christ's redemption accomplished. Our worship
                    embodies the gospel as we experience God's presence.</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>4.</b><strong> Multi-Cultural Church and
                        Church Planting
                    </strong> We are committed to being a multi-cultural church
                    and church planting movement. We believe that the church,
                    the household of God, is an essential element of the gospel
                    into which people of every tribe and nation are welcomed.
                    While affirming that every follower of Christ is called to
                    be a witness to the truth and grace of God revealed in Jesus
                    Christ, we also believe that true evangelism is best
                    accomplished through church planting. It is therefore our
                    ambition to be not only a growing church, but also a growing
                    church planting movement. While holding to a time-honored
                    understanding of faith, we are strategically progressive.
                    Our aim is to plant churches that reach the different
                    cultures in our city, New England and the world. For more

                        herf="https://anabaino.org">anabaino.org.</a>

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because no one
                    culture is closer to God than another, you don't have to
                    become American (or Western, or whatever!) to become
                    Christian, and the communal witness of the gospel is the
                    best testament to its power!</p>

                <p class="body-text"><b>5.</b><strong> High View of Christian
                        Calling - We are committed to a high view of Christian
                        calling as reflected in the vocational spheres of
                        family, church, and public service.
                    </strong>We believe that God has given us roles that reflect
                    his own sovereign design to accomplish his work in the
                    world, which extends into the spheres of family, church and
                    civil vocations. We desire to help people find a balance
                    that is unique to their individual callings and spheres of
                    service. While believing that the Christian Scriptures does
                    not address all things pertaining to life in this world, we
                    do affirm that we should take
                    "every thought captive to the obedience of Christ" and that
                    the Christian worldview is applicable and relevant to all
                    spheres of life.

                    <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because God
                    didn't make us just one way or with one part of ourselves,
                    but made ALL of us, and he deserves it all to be offered as
                    thankful worship.</p>

                    Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven, is a member of the
                    Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one of many
                    communions in the church universal, the PCA may be
                    distinguished by its affirmation of what has been described
                    as the "Reformed system of faith" as reflected in the
                    Westminster Confession of Faith. The PCA is characterized by
                    its emphasis on both personal revival and theological
                    reformation. By promoting reformation and revival, we seek
                    to carry out the Great Commission with Biblical integrity
                    and personal authenticity unto the glory of God.

                    <h1>Our Total Christ Spirituality</h1></div>
                <p class="body-text">We want this to be all about Christ—his
                    work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and
                    one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader,
                    as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is
                    our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or
                    another brand of Christ.

                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    The term “Total Christ” originates from the 5th-century
                    pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the
                    relationship of Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to
                    his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as “the Word was
                    made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined
                    the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and
                    body.”

                </p>

                <h3>The Five Marks</h3>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>1. Gospel-Centered:</strong> Trust in the gospel
                    motivates us to be humble because we know Christ’s work to
                    us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face
                    of shame and sin because it’s based in God’s power! This
                    grounds us in God’s finished work on the cross, where he
                    forgave our sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we
                    do is motivated from and by the gospel.
                    <strong>Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious,
                        safe</strong>

                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>2. Missional: </strong> More (though not less!) than
                    being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God
                    promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given
                    cultures, languages, and demographics through the church.
                    This grounds us in God’s global presence, where the church
                    is the evangelist for a whole new way of life, showing the
                    world who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him in all
                    our relationships.
                    <strong>Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting,
                        purposeful, holistic evangelismsafe</strong>

                    <strong>3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet:
                    </strong>We are not the first ones to consider what church
                    should be (thank God!). We humbly submit to God’s revelation
                    in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking
                    to be united in belief across generations and cultures.
                    Officially, we subscribe to the 1630 documents of
                    Westminster as the summary of our faith. This grounds us in
                    Christ as our Prophet who still speaks.
                    <strong>Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness
                        to be distracted by cultural fads</strong>

                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest:
                    </strong> We
                    desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein
                    Christ our Priest is "fleshed out" in a carefully designed
                    four movement worship service that follows the four
                    movements of the gospel and culminates every week in a
                    participation in eucharistic communion with Christ as
                    "fleshed out" in cultural styles specific to each local
                    community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)!
                    <strong>Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>5. Communal - Christ as our King:</strong>Christ did
                    not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the
                    church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed
                    community. Many of us experience Christ first through the
                    love of his body. We also take church government as an
                    instrument of mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as
                    our King.
                    <strong>Think: loving, humble, one-anotherings</strong>

                    Mission Anabaino (MA) seeks to fulfill the “greater things”
                    in relation to Christ’s great expectations regarding his
                    ascension ministry today. It involves participating in the
                    real and personal advent of Christ through church planting
                    and the ecumenically-oriented rediscovery of missional
                    ecclesiology.
