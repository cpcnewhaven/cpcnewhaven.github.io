                            callings and spheres of service. While believing
                            that the Christian Scriptures does not address all
                            things pertaining to life in this world, we do
                            affirm that we should take
                            "every thought captive to the obedience of Christ"
                            and that the Christian worldview is applicable and
                            relevant to all spheres of life.
                            <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> Because
                            God didn't make us just one way or with one part of
                            ourselves, but made ALL of us, and he deserves it
                            all to be offered as thankful worship.

                Christ Presbyterian Church, New Haven, is a member
                of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). As one
                of many communions in the church universal, the PCA
                may be distinguished by its affirmation of what has
                been described as the "Reformed system of faith" as
                reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith.
                The PCA is characterized by its emphasis on both
                personal revival and theological reformation. By
                promoting reformation and revival, we seek to carry
                out the Great Commission with Biblical integrity and
                personal authenticity unto the glory of God.
