<h4><span>Life groups</span></h4></section>
<p><span>Life Groups:</span>  Are our way of doing church in the small with all sorts of people engaged in prayer, teaching, fellowship and care. They are the vehicle that we use to help all who participate, to continue to expirence Christ outside of our worship gatherings and to impart with pastoral care that CHrist provides through the love of hois people. Thus, the worship, teachings,  fellowship, and care for one another supply a more intamate and hands-on encounter with the living Christ.</p>
