      "title": "PASTOR’S BOOK PICK - The Life We’re Looking For",
      "description": "This summer, we’re suggesting that you pick up Andy Crouch’s latest book - The Life We’re Looking For: Reclaiming Relationship in a Technological World. This is a perfect followup to The Soul of Shame, as it gets us to reconsider all the ways we are distracted or prevented from deeper relationships. Crouch is a wonderfully thoughtful and practical Christian thinker, who served as a Campus Minister at Harvard, and now works primarily as a consultant at Praxis for redemptive entrepreneurship. This is a great summer read to help us all prioritize and re-calibrate our lives around Christ! Copies are in the foyer, pay what you can.",
