      "description": "<h3>You Are Not Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World,</h3><h4> by Alan Noble</h4><p>This book examines many of the ways in which our culture reinforces the lie that we belong to ourselves, and then provides a road map to avoid falling into sinful traps. Written by English professor and PCA church member Alan Noble, it points out the cultural and technological habits we all form, and then encourages us to fight against them, armed with the gospel-centered truth that we actually belong to God.</p><p>Noble is a clear and witty writer, with the ability to see through deeply ingrained sinful habits, giving us hope and liberation for a more godly lifestyle. Copies are in the foyer, please pay $ what you can.</p>",
