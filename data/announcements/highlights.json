      "description": "This summer, we’re suggesting that you pick up Andy Crouch’s latest book - The Life We’re Looking For: Reclaiming Relationship in a Technological World. This is a perfect followup to The Soul of Shame, as it gets us to reconsider all the ways we are distracted or prevented from deeper relationships. Crouch is a wonderfully thoughtful and practical Christian thinker, who served as a Campus Minister at Harvard, and now works primarily as a consultant at Praxis for redemptive entrepreneurship. This is a great summer read to help us all prioritize and re-calibrate our lives around Christ! Copies are in the foyer, pay what you can.",

We’ll be showing the video after the service in the Fellowship Hall on June 23, July 21, and Aug. 18. You need to only come once. Light snacks will be provided.",

      "description": "The staff have been hard at work updating the bulletin, and we are unveiling the new one this Sunday. There are 2 main changes. First, we have removed the reasoning and biblical quotes that remain the same each week and created a separate insert that will live in the pews. This “Worship Guide” explains our movements of worship. Second, we removed the song lyrics, which will be a change for many people who have grown dependent on the text in hand. If you struggle with reading the slides for worship, we’re still providing a Large Print bulletin. With the lyrics removed, however, we hope it will encourage all of our eyes to be lifted up and singing in more communal ways. We know change can be difficult but hopefully it feels more like who we are and allows for more dynamic worship.",
