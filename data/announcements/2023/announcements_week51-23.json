      "title": "DROP-IN TIME WITH PASTOR CRAIG",
      "schedule": "Fridays from 7am-10am",
      "description": "Anyone is invited to come to Craig’s office, 2nd floor of the old building (you may ring the Bradley St. doorbell), for a casual time of discussion, Q&A, prayer, coffee, tea, really whatever you want to make it! Wondering what God is doing in a certain part of your life? Let’s wonder together! Are you reading Emotionally Healthy Spirituality? Let’s discuss! Have a tricky situation at home or work? Let’s discern best steps! Want to just chat about nothing in particular? Come on in! If you have a more private or formal need, you’re always welcome to set up a separate time with Pastor Craig (craig.luekens@cpcnewhaven.org), but this is meant to be a space where anyone can drop in. Confirm that Craig is there on any given week on the calendar:"
