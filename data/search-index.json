A Letter from Pastor Craig If you are interested in joining us on this mission trip, please email your interest to Alexis at admin@cpcnewhaven.org. We look forward to serving together! Last spring, we convened a mission trip planning committee, and after several meetings discussing vision, purpose, and a number of different potential sites - both national and international - we decided on New City Fellowship in Atlantic City, NJ. They have a longstanding mission in the inner city of Atlantic City, as part of a PCA church planting network, and have hosted mission teams for many years. We will be one of their “Urban Ministry Teams.” As they describe it on their website (https://www.mnashortterm.org/new-city-atlantic-city) “The goal of Urban Ministry Teams is to assist in the evangelism and development of selected Atlantic City neighborhoods and to give your team a vision for racial reconciliation, ministry to the poor, joy in worship and urban mercy ministry that your team can replicate once they return home.” Feel free to read more about the mission at the link above. We believe this mission has the potential to impact people’s lives immediately for the gospel, as well as give us a vision and passion for mission in our own backyard. We have reserved Aug. 2-9 (though we have time to move those dates if enough people require a July week), so the team will worship with them on Sunday Aug. 3. Please join me in giving thanks and praise to God for our planning committee team - Patty Chuchta, Meg Bogue, Blake Boles, Natalie Billings, Karen Peck, Susan White, Allison Luekens, Pastor Jerry, and myself. May the Spirit continue to be at work in our church as we seek to live out the wonderful news of the gospel and may we be able to strive with Paul, \"that I may know Christ and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.\" (Phil. 3:10-11) Much love in Christ, Craig ----- Rev.

Our Total Christ Spirituality We want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ. The term \"Total Christ\" originates from the 5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body.\" The Five Marks 1. Gospel-Centered: Trust in the gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin because it's based in God's power! This grounds us in God's finished work on the cross, where he forgave our sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is motivated from and by the gospel. Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire to be truly known and loved by God and others 2. Missional: More (though not less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages, and demographics through the church. This grounds us in God's global presence, where the church is the evangelist for a whole new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him in all our relationships. Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful, holistic evangelism 3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet: We are not the first ones to consider what church should be (thank God!). We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe to the documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of our faith. This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still speaks. Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness to be distracted by cultural fads 4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest: Christ is \"fleshed out\" in a carefully designed four movement worship service that follows the logic of the gospel and culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion with Christ. Jesus is experienced in the body of Christ through different cultural styles specific to each local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5). Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious 5. Communal - Christ as our King: Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community. Many of us experience Christ first through the love of his body. We also take church government as an instrument of mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our King. Think: loving, humble accountability and one-anothering Our Commitments We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A community united in the love of Jesus changes lives and communities. We hope that Sunday worship is the touchstone of our lives and that it bleeds into how we treat each other inside and outside of the church. Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian - or even Christian - so please feel comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to be a community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and have the privilege to embody it in the church. Our Five Basic Commitments 1. Scripture - We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice. While believing that God powerfully manifests his infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses. We want the God of grace and glory to be our only Lord. 2. Teachings of Grace - We are committed to the teachings of grace as they are summarized in the historic Westminster Confession of Faith. Whereas the Holy Scriptures is our only rule of faith and practice, Church unity is predicated upon a consensus about what the Scriptures principally teach. Our consensus is reflected in the 350-year--old Westminster Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that God is no less sovereign in our salvation than He is sovereign in our creation, to the praise of God's glorious grace! This means that we are accepted by God, from beginning to end, not by our own works or attempts to perform for God, but by faith alone in the perfect and all sufficient work of Christ on our behalf, faith itself being the free gift of God. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To affirm the sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women who have gone…","category":"About","updated":"2026-01-09"},{"url":"adult-sunday-school.html","title":"Adult Sunday Studies - CPC New Haven Church","description":"Explore Adult Sunday Studies at CPC New Haven Church.

Written by English professor and PCA church member Alan Noble, it points out the cultural and technological habits we all form, and then encourages us to fight against them, armed with the gospel-centered truth that we actually belong to God. Noble is a clear and witty writer, with the ability to see through deeply ingrained sinful habits, giving us hope and liberation for a more godly lifestyle.

The very gospel that sets us free from the fear of divine and human condemnation is the same power that transforms our relationships, work, and worship. Biblical discipleship, including word, worship, and fellowship, exists at CPC primarily through Sunday worship, courses offered through the School of Discipleship, and Men's and Women's Discipleship Groups.

Get Started with Groups Learn More About Groups Ministries Children Youth Undergraduate Graduate Mercy Men Women Children In an attempt to assist our covenant families in raising their children in the grace of the gospel, we have developed a thoughtful and comprehensive approach towards providing your children with deep and enduring roots in the Christian faith. Our philosophy emphasizes close parent/church cooperation. As a result, our strategy for \"making disciples\" seeks to be primarily relational rather than programmatic. Our curriculum represents both a deductive and inductive approach to education that is intended to give our children a lasting and full knowledge of the Christian faith. Our goal, then, is to help our children become faithful disciples of Christ, well prepared to live and defend the Gospel into the 21st century. By the time a child leaves their home, they will have been trained in: Youth Our youth ministry at CPC is the capstone of our broader children's ministry, and targets both junior and senior high. We have many various goings-on throughout the year, but here are some of the offerings we have for our youth: Sunday School: CPC's Sunday School program goes from preschool through graduation. Our goal is to partner with parents in the Christian discipleship of their kids, in order that our kids ultimately embrace the gospel of grace for themselves. One-On-One Discipleship: Beyond our calendar events, we seek to schedule one-on-one time with students for discipleship. This takes the form of going out for lunch, monthly fellowship gatherings, ice cream, or anything that gives us an opportunity to deepen relationships and minister to the students' needs. For any inquiries regarding our youth ministry, contact Jerry Ornelas Undergraduate CPC's college ministry is a collection of students from wide-ranging backgrounds gathered under the banner of Jesus Christ. Mostly made up of Yale, Southern (SCSU) and Gateway students, the college ministry also includes students from other area universities. CPC seeks to help students love Christ, love the church, and love the campus life to which they are called. Because we love the campus, we send campus ministers to the campus, but above all, we invite students to take part in the fullness of Christ through CPC's rich, communal Sunday morning worship. Students, please honor us with your presence and unique gifts! One-on-One and Small Group Discipleship Depending on the needs of the students or campus, we are also deeply committed to individual and small group discipleship on campus. This has been happening at Yale and Southern, and we look to serve students of all local campuses (Quinnipiac, Gateway, and Albertus Magnus) in the future. For any inquiries regarding our Undergraduate ministry, contact Jerry Ornelas Bridging the Church-Campus Gap This is our internship program for college students interested in learning more, investing more, being more knit in to the family of God.

Pastor's Book Pick You Are Not Your Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World by Alan Noble This book examines many of the ways in which our culture reinforces the lie that we belong to ourselves, and then provides a road map to avoid falling into sinful traps. Written by English professor and PCA church member Alan Noble, it points out the cultural and technological habits we all form, and then encourages us to fight against them, armed with the gospel-centered truth that we actually belong to God. Noble is a clear and witty writer, with the ability to see through deeply ingrained sinful habits, giving us hope and liberation for a more godly lifestyle. Copies are in the foyer, please pay $ what you can. Parent's Book Pick God Made Me for Worship: Helping Children Understand Church by Jared Kennedy Worship is what we were made for—and that includes our kids! Teaching them to sit through and take part in worship isn't always easy, but it's such a beautiful journey as we watch them grow in the same faith we hold dear. This is a great resource to help little ones see what's really happening during a church service.

Mercy Fund Application The primary and first level of mercy assistance begins at the small group level where needs are most readily discerned and the individual dynamics understood in coordination with the small group coordinator. When assistance exceeds the ability of the small group, then the small group coordinator contacts the CPC Mercy coordinator who will consult with the Sr. Pastor and develop a plan for addressing the need. In the case of financial assistance, this application should be filled out and returned to our administrator. Or you may submit the application through an online form here . Life Event Support Initiative As the body of Christ, we desire to support members during major life transitions or events in ways consistent with being the family of God. Showering members with prayer in contexts of communal celebrations or grieving can be a great blessing, witness, and support to members in a way that makes tangible Christ's promise \"I will never leave you nor forsake you\" (Heb.13:5). During Christ's ascension ministry, we know that this promise is no less true given Christ's presence as mediated through the body of Christ on earth that renders the words of Christ in Matthew just prior to his ascension all the more realistic, \"Behold, I am with you until the end of the age\" (Mt 28:20). To learn more, refer to section 7.9 in the Leadership Handbook below. Leadership Handbook The Leadership Handbook provides information related to leadership including CPC policies and expectations. Scripture Reader Guidelines Please refer to the Scripture Reader Guidelines when reading scripture during a worship service for information about reading and the microphone/lectern.

If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.\" - 1 Corinthians 12:24-26 God's people are the hands and feet of Christ. We cannot experience God and grow spiritually in a truly gospel-centered and biblical way if we are living in isolation. Neither can we say we are flourishing if our brother or sister in Christ is suffering. Bound together with covenant communion, God brings us into new relationships where sacrifice is freedom and giving to others is where we find life. Life Groups are our way of doing church in the small with all sorts of people engaged in prayer, teaching, fellowship and care. They are the vehicle that we use to help its participants continue to experience Christ outside of our worship gatherings and to impart the pastoral care that Christ provides through the love of His people. Thus, the worship, teaching, fellowship, and care for one another supply a more intimate and hands-on encounter with the living Christ.

A vow is a \"confession\" regarding one's participation in a given institution, typically used in three divinely sanctioned institutions: the church, the state, and the family. According to Romans 10:9, one becomes a Christian when \"you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead.\" This confession, along with the elders' responsibility to \"watch over the flock of God,\" forms the foundation of church membership. Church membership is a good thing - it sets people apart into a special relationship with each other, where terms are clear and loyalties for mutual benefit are expressed and preserved. It's simply saying: \"I confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to enjoy the mutual support of one another.\" Contact Us About Membership Ready to take the next step?

Our Total Christ Spirituality We want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ. The term \"Total Christ\" originates from the 5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body.\" The Five Marks 1. Gospel-Centered: Trust in the gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin because it's based in God's power! This grounds us in God's finished work on the cross, where he forgave our sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is motivated from and by the gospel. Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire to be truly known and loved by God and others 2. Missional: More (though not less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages, and demographics through the church. This grounds us in God's global presence, where the church is the evangelist for a whole new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him in all our relationships. Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful, holistic evangelismsafe 3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet: We are not the first ones to consider what church should be (thank God!). We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe to the documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of our faith. This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still speaks. Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness to be distracted by cultural fads 4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest: We desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein Christ our Priest is \"fleshed out\" in a carefully designed four movement worship service that follows the four movements of the gospel and culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion with Christ as \"fleshed out\" in cultural styles specific to each local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)! Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious 5. Communal - Christ as our King: Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community. Many of us experience Christ first through the love of his body. We also take church government as an instrument of mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our King. Think: loving, humble, one-anotherings Our Commitments We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A community united in the love of Jesus changes lives and communities. We hope that Sunday worship is the touchstone of our lives and that it bleeds into how we treat each other inside and outside of the church. Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian - or even Christian - so please feel comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to be a community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and have the privilege to embody it in the church. Our Five Basic Commitments 1. Scripture - We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice. While believing that God powerfully manifests his infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses. We want the God of grace and glory to be our only Lord.

Craig Luekens","Senior Pastor"],"text":"Home Sundays About Podcasts Events Announcements Community Live Resources Give Rev. Craig Luekens Senior Pastor Craig was born and raised in Indianapolis, IN, and was brought up in the Jewish faith through high school. In college - at Indiana University - he began asking deeper, more existential questions about purpose, meaning, and the existence of God. At the start of Sophomore year he committed his life to Christ. Having become convinced of the truth of Scripture, the Spirit convicted him that Jesus alone demands and deserves everything. In hopes of pursuing an academic career, he attended Yale Divinity School, completing a MDiv in 2008. God drew him to Christ Presbyterian Church and eventually to the ministry through CPC, where he also began work with Athletes in Action at Yale, a sports ministry for undergrad student-athletes. Craig was ordained as a Teaching Elder in the PCA in 2012 and completed a ThM in 2014 at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary in Biblical Theology. Having begun his role as Senior Pastor in 2023, his primary responsibilities include preaching, teaching, pastoral counseling, and moderating the Session/WLB (Shepherd Leaders) and Servant Leadership Boards. Craig has three kids - Charlotte (b. 2009); Julian (b. 2011); and Eli (b.2014) - from a previous marriage. He and Allison were married in 2021. Craig was a semi-professional cyclist before pursuing the ministry and always seeks more ways to merge his two loves as much as he can - discussing a good book on a good ride.","category":"About","updated":"2025-06-14"},{"url":"pastor-jerry.html","title":"Rev.

Jerry Ornelas","Assistant Pastor"],"text":"Home Sundays About Podcasts Events Announcements Community Live Resources Give Rev. Jerry Ornelas Assistant Pastor Jerry was born in Pasadena, California. At nine years of age he and his family moved to Savannah Georgia where he spent the majority of his formative years. Being a high school football player offered him the opportunity to play at the college level at Trinity International in Deerfield, Illinois. After several injuries the Lord providentially took away the desire to play football and replaced it with a desire for ministry. After years of wrestling with whether or not he should pursue vocational ministry the Lord sent him to Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi to pursue a Masters of Divinity. During his four years of training he spent the summer of 2018 interning at Christ Presbyterian Church. This eventually, in God's providence, turned into a call to serve as an Assistant Pastor as well as starting a college ministry at Southern Connecticut State University. Some of his passions are: traveling, spending time in nature such as hiking, kayaking and camping. Reading fiction and non-fiction, theology, philosophy, apologetics and science books are a joy and a delight to him. Using these various genres, along with sports and nature are tools he uses to disciple and point people to Jesus Christ.","category":"About","updated":"2025-06-14"},{"url":"podcasts.html","title":"Podcasts - CPC New Haven Church","description":"CPC New Haven Church - Podcast Archive.

(WCF 1.4) Concerning Usability: …[That] in a due use of the ordinary means, [we] may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them. (WCF 1.5) [Wherein] the whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.

Our method is confessional. The confessional method is distinguished from systematic, historical, philosophical, or even social theologies, if also sharing in some elements inherent to each of them. It is at the end an exercise of faith formation that will consider the related topics as from the vantage point of divine revelation intended for people of faith. It therefore involves reading the bible communally as revealed not only to individuals, but to that organic body of Christ described as the “pillar and bulwark of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). Such communal interpretation has the advantage of transcending any one geo-political/historical expression. It is an attempt to understand God’s revelation in scripture aided by that consensus of the church across the ages. Our primary source will be within Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF), one historical expression of the catholic faith. A secondary aim of this course is to satisfy one of the prerequisite courses toward becoming a CPC Sunday school teacher, community/discipleship group facilitator, elder, and women's leadership board member. 1.
