A Letter from Pastor Craig If you are interested in joining us on this mission trip, please email your interest to Alexis at admin@cpcnewhaven.org. We look forward to serving together! Last spring, we convened a mission trip planning committee, and after several meetings discussing vision, purpose, and a number of different potential sites - both national and international - we decided on New City Fellowship in Atlantic City, NJ. They have a longstanding mission in the inner city of Atlantic City, as part of a PCA church planting network, and have hosted mission teams for many years. We will be one of their “Urban Ministry Teams.” As they describe it on their website (https://www.mnashortterm.org/new-city-atlantic-city) “The goal of Urban Ministry Teams is to assist in the evangelism and development of selected Atlantic City neighborhoods and to give your team a vision for racial reconciliation, ministry to the poor, joy in worship and urban mercy ministry that your team can replicate once they return home.” Feel free to read more about the mission at the link above. We believe this mission has the potential to impact people’s lives immediately for the gospel, as well as give us a vision and passion for mission in our own backyard. We have reserved Aug. 2-9 (though we have time to move those dates if enough people require a July week), so the team will worship with them on Sunday Aug. 3. Please join me in giving thanks and praise to God for our planning committee team - Patty Chuchta, Meg Bogue, Blake Boles, Natalie Billings, Karen Peck, Susan White, Allison Luekens, Pastor Jerry, and myself. May the Spirit continue to be at work in our church as we seek to live out the wonderful news of the gospel and may we be able to strive with Paul, \"that I may know Christ and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.\" (Phil. 3:10-11) Much love in Christ, Craig ----- Rev.

Our Total Christ Spirituality We want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ. The term \"Total Christ\" originates from the 5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body.\" The Five Marks 1. Gospel-Centered: Trust in the gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin because it's based in God's power! This grounds us in God's finished work on the cross, where he forgave our sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is motivated from and by the gospel. Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire to be truly known and loved by God and others 2. Missional: More (though not less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages, and demographics through the church. This grounds us in God's global presence, where the church is the evangelist for a whole new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him in all our relationships. Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful, holistic evangelism 3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet: We are not the first ones to consider what church should be (thank God!). We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe to the documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of our faith. This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still speaks. Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness to be distracted by cultural fads 4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest: Christ is \"fleshed out\" in a carefully designed four movement worship service that follows the logic of the gospel and culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion with Christ. Jesus is experienced in the body of Christ through different cultural styles specific to each local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5). Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious 5. Communal - Christ as our King: Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community. Many of us experience Christ first through the love of his body. We also take church government as an instrument of mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our King. Think: loving, humble accountability and one-anothering Our Commitments We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A community united in the love of Jesus changes lives and communities. We hope that Sunday worship is the touchstone of our lives and that it bleeds into how we treat each other inside and outside of the church. Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian - or even Christian - so please feel comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to be a community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and have the privilege to embody it in the church. Our Five Basic Commitments 1. Scripture - We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice. While believing that God powerfully manifests his infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses. We want the God of grace and glory to be our only Lord. 2. Teachings of Grace - We are committed to the teachings of grace as they are summarized in the historic Westminster Confession of Faith. Whereas the Holy Scriptures is our only rule of faith and practice, Church unity is predicated upon a consensus about what the Scriptures principally teach. Our consensus is reflected in the 350-year--old Westminster Confession of Faith. In summary, it affirms that God is no less sovereign in our salvation than He is sovereign in our creation, to the praise of God's glorious grace! This means that we are accepted by God, from beginning to end, not by our own works or attempts to perform for God, but by faith alone in the perfect and all sufficient work of Christ on our behalf, faith itself being the free gift of God. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To affirm the sovereignty of grace, to connect us to wise men and women who have gone before us, and to prevent as much as possible our historical and cultural blind-spots. 3. God-Centered Worship - We are committed to God-centered worship designed after a covenantal pattern, where Christ promises to be present through Word and Sacrament. In every period of redemptive history, God has chosen to be with his people through the divine institutions of word, sacrament and prayers. Today, through the sacraments of the Lord's Supper and Christian Baptism, together with the preaching of God's word and corporate prayers (both sung and unsung), God has promised to be with us until the end of the age. Our worship is set to the pattern of covenant initiation and renewal including the weekly participation of the Lord's supper. Our music and style of worship is \"blended\" to reflect the vernacular context of those God has brought to our city. Our desire is for our worship to be as God-centered as our theology, communicating the truth and grace of God to the nations. We welcome all believers together with those who are searching. WHY SHOULD I CARE? Not only is it biblical, but it keeps us grounded in the gospel every week, secured upon Christ's redemption accomplished. Our worship embodies the gospel as we experience God's presence. 4. Multi-Cultural Church and Church Planting We are committed to being a multi-cultural church and church planting movement. We believe that the church, the household of God, is an essential element of the gospel into which people of every tribe and nation are welcomed. While affirming that every follower of Christ is called to be a witness to the truth and grace of God revealed in Jesus Christ, we also believe that true evangelism is best accomplished through church planting. It is therefore our ambition to be not only a growing church, but also a growing church planting movement. While holding to a time-honored understanding of faith, we are strategically progressive. Our aim is to plant churches that reach the different cultures in our city, New England and the world. For more info on church planting, visit anabaino.org . WHY SHOULD I CARE? Because no one culture is closer to God than another, you don't have to become American (or Western, or whatever!) to become Christian, and the communal witness of the gospel is the best testament to its power! 5. High View of Christian Calling - We are committed to a high view of Christian calling as reflected in the vocational spheres of family, church, and public service. We believe that God has given us roles that reflect his own sovereign design to accomplish his work in the world, which extends into the spheres of family, church and civil vocations. We desire to help people find a balance that is unique to their individual callings and spheres of service. While believing that the Christian Scriptures does not address all things pertaining to life in this world, we do affirm that we should take \"every thought captive to the obedience of Christ\" and that the Christian worldview is applicable and relevant to all spheres of life. WHY SHOULD I CARE? Because God didn't make us just one way or with one part of ourselves, but made ALL of us, and he deserves it all to be offered as thankful worship.

It involves participating in the real and personal advent of Christ through church planting and the ecumenically-oriented rediscovery of missional ecclesiology. For more info, visit anabaino.org Our Story It all began in the summer of 1991 when three young families and a graduate student at Yale scheduled a ferry ride from Bridgeport, CT to Port Jefferson, NY. Their purpose was to meet up with several church planters and pastors from the Presbyterian Church in America (Tim Keller, Skip Ryan and Charlie Drew) to discuss a possible church plant in New Haven. Meanwhile, recent Gordon Conwell Seminary graduate Preston Graham was scheduled to visit New Haven in order to locate sufficient housing for his family while a graduate student in American Religious History at Yale. Having been introduced to one of the families prior to coming, Preston was invited to join them in their providential ferry ride to \"Port Jeff.\" After about a three hour conversation on Long Island, and while dreaming and scheming together on the return trip back from Port Jeff, Preston accepted an invitation from the small contingency to lead a Bible Study while at Yale until such time as the group could locate a church planter. During the '91-'92 academic year, the group was joined by a few others (about 8 in all) and met every Thursday evening in the Westville area of New Haven. As the year progressed, the group began to discern a vision for a church in New Haven that would blend together a progressive, gospel-centered and missional-oriented emphasis (\"High Gospel\") coupled with a classically defined confessional, sacramental and communal-oriented emphasis (\"High Church) in church planting. And the conviction for such a church in New Haven escalated. Even as the group grew in their conviction for a high gospel, high church presence of Christ in New Haven, Preston was invited to preach a final candidacy sermon at a congregation in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. His sermon text on Matthew's great commission (Mt. 28) was met with great enthusiasm, especially by a man who just happened to be a senior undergraduate and acting president of the Intervarsity Fellowship at Yale. Immediately after the sermon, the student greeted Preston with both the perceived need for \"such a church in New Haven as you describe\" along with a challenge to consider planting a church in downtown New Haven rather than accept a pastoral position in Atlanta. As Preston tells it, and contrary to all previous planning and expectations, \"the voice of God could not have been more clear and compelling\" (the human mind plans the way, but the Lord directs the steps. Prov.16:9). What then is commonly called a core group (or launch team) development phase in church planting was completed, if humanly speaking, unintended -- a church conceived! After spending the summer raising needed funds to cover a total first year budget of $73,000, Preston was ordained and commissioned in September of 1992 by then Northeast Presbytery of the PCA as an evangelist to plant a church in New Haven under the supervision of a church in distant Nashua, New Hampshire. Meanwhile, with a vision to build a church like an oak tree vs. a mushroom plant, all the members of the launch team (about 8 in all initially) agreed to a year long study in confessional theology while serving as a leadership team for the mission church. After much discussion, a name for the church was prayerfully discerned as \"Christ Presbyterian Church\" under the inspiration of Colossians 1:18, \"that Christ might have first place in everything.\" Soon afterwards, on October 11,1992 at 9:30 am, the \"mission\" stage of church planting was initiated with a first worship service held at the Amity Regional Junior High in Orange, CT. It was of no small inconvenience that the worship room was a small, windowless choir room with chairs suitable for junior high students! The sermon text that morning was Matthew 28 coupled with Christ's promise \"I will build my church\" (Mt 16). In attendance were 28 people, children and adults combined (more children than adults). Envisioned as a \"quiet launch,\" there was initially no advertisement of the service other than by word of mouth. But the church began to grow, if slowly. During this first year, the expositional sermons were from Ephesians. Meanwhile, the launch team continued to meet during the week for study and leadership, even as most were involved in teaching children Sunday School that met after worship while the adults participated in the novel, at the time, practice of sermon discussions. Within the first four months, the congregation grew to about 22 adults (college, graduate and young professionals) and 26 children members. A high gospel, high church congregation was born! In two years, and after completing a sermon series through the book of Jonah with an emphasis upon God's love for \"the city,\" the congregation agreed to begin transitioning to downtown New Haven. On August 1, 1994 a study center and church office was leased at 383 Orange St. consisting of a library/prayer room, a meeting room, a pastor's study, and an office for then seminarian apprentice George Levesque. On August 28, 1994, Sunday worship was relocated nearby at the Neighborhood Music School located at 100 Audubon Street. November 6, 1994 at 4:00 PM, there was a special service of \"organization\" whereby church planter-evangelist Preston Graham was installed as the pastor and Cliff Bogue, Robert Hawkes and George Levesque were ordained as ruling elders. Also during this time, family groups were established - one in Orange, one in Westville, and one in Guilford. By God's grace, the 1994-1995 years were characterized by many wonderful evidences of spiritual power and transformation. Between the months of September 1994 and August 1995, there were 7 professions of faith together with many signs of growing spiritual maturity in the members. Of particular importance was a growing commitment to family worship in families. By the end of August 1995, the membership had grown to 77 and the weekly worship attendance was averaging 140. As previously committed to planting a first church prior to purchasing a building, by God's grace in the following year, plans were laid with Yale Divinity Student and CPC intern, Mel Sensenig, toward planting a daughter church in downtown Providence, R.I. This was initiated in 1997. As the church grew and its commitment to New Haven increased, on September 5, 1997, Christ Presbyterian Church became the 4th owner of 135 Whitney Avenue with its 1850 Gothic Revival Cottage for the price of $400,000. As designed by Architect Jackson Downing and featured in his The Architecture of Country House (1850) under the title \"A Symmetrical Cottage Design # 7,\" Downing described the cottage as combining \"the beautiful with the good\" as commissioned by Esra Reid, President of the Bank of New Haven, for his aging parents. (c.f. picture in church parlor). In 1922, the cottage was sold to its second owner, Father Riggs, the first Catholic chaplain at Yale and founder of St. Thomas Moore Chapel (c.f. alcove outside the Sr. Pastor office where the patron saint would have most likely stood. For a short biography of Father Riggs including a delightful description of his use of the \"Gate House\" cottage, c.f. \"Father Riggs of Yale by Stephen Schmalhofer, The New Criterion, March 24, 2021). In 1958, the cottage was sold to Dr. Jack McGrail and converted to a Dentist office and drug store (in the basement), later to be converted into law offices for rent when CPC pursued purchasing it as it's study center and potential property for the building of a modest Sanctuary. Involving both the sweat and financial equity of CPC members and friends, CPC immediately initiated a much needed renovation project on the cottage involving a restoration to its original design. Due to outgrowing the Neighborhood Music School, the church moved its worship service to the Marquand Chapel at the Yale Divinity School the summer of 1998. In 1999, the church hired an associate pastor of college ministry to assist in ministry with Yale students especially. And in 2000, the church hired a part time Music and Worship Arts coordinator, Dan Kellogg, toward developing greater participation and excellence in Sacred Music. Meanwhile, momentum and enthusiasm grew along with the need to acquire a permanent worship facility. As the congregation had grown to approximately 200 people, the church established an ambitious three part strategy to: Establish a Reformed University Ministry at Yale, an affiliated ministry with the PCA denomination committed to Christian discipleship from a gospel driven and reformed perspective Establish Hope For New Haven, a separate faith-based, non-profit subsidiary organization of CPC as a collaborative project with other like minded churches in New Haven for the purpose of bringing the hope of Christ to the \"outward\" needs of our city through a child care program and counseling center. Initiate a 3.5 million dollar building project to renovate the basement of the existing study center for additional programming space, and to design and build a multi-story facility of about 10,000 sq. feet to house a worship facility, a day care facility and additional classroom space upstairs. In April of 2001, after two years of legal, political, financial and architectural preparations, there was groundbreaking at 135 Whitney Avenue! But not without some high drama involving both the approval of the city building commission by a 1 vote margin, and the miraculous and last minute anonymous gift at the time of $850k to complete financing. After a year of building, the city granted CPC a temporary certificate of occupancy in April of 2002 for the adjoining sanctuary and fellowship hall just in time for a first worship service on Easter Sunday. The sanctuary was not yet carpeted or painted, but it was consecrated by the sacred temple presence of Christ wherein it could be said that \"Christ filled all in all\" (Eph 1:23). After several years of being saddled by an enormous financial burden preventing CPC from proactively expressing its church planting DNA, a vision was established to seek God's power in paying down the mortgage. In God's mercy, without any \"campaign\" other than to make the need known to members and friends, the 3.5 million mortgage was paid in full. A \"burning of the mortgage\" ceremony was had, together with the excitement of planting churches again. This was initiated by the hire of Rev. David Hutchinson in planting a daughter church in Danbury, CT. During this time, CPC was being led to distinguish its missional identity and theological vision for planting under the title \"Total Christ\" as summarized by the \"Five Marks\" of a Total Christ church as an essential element of Christ's ascension ministry - and thus the conception \"Mission Anabaino\" (I am ascending, c.f. anabaino.org). It was also felt that the same God who could miraculously raise up 3.5 million to pay down a mortgage could just as well raise the same for the exclusive vision of planting churches, both locally in Southern CT and globally. With the strategic plan of \"10-10-10\" (ten local churches and ten global churches in ten years), a campaign was begun. In less than two years, and again with no campaign other than to make the need known and prayer, God granted CPC its goal. As of the Spring of 2017, Mission Anabaino is inspiring a multiplying momentum for both an engagement in theological collaboration in missional ecclesiology and church planting. At present, Mission Anabaino consists of five local church plants, 12 global church plants with 3 anchor churches including CPC New Haven. The congregation at 135 Whitney Ave. continues to flourish, albeit having to engage the increasing challenge, and opportunities, of the post-Christian, and yet post-secular, context of our postmodern city. The Continuing Church The great 18th century Congregationalist pastor, scholar and revivalist Jonathan Edwards once wrote to a friend that \"the Presbyterian way has ever appeared to me most agreeable to the word of God and the reason and nature of things.\"* At the time, it is probable that Edwards never would have imagined a high gospel and high church \"Presbyterian\" congregation in Congregationalist saturated New Haven right across the street from his alma mater. Perhaps even more ironic, the Puritan Congregationalist church in Edwards' day utilized the same Westminster Shorter Catechism that CPC utilizes to this day in the catechesis of our children and adults. And as it happens, New Haven colony was the location for its printing on behalf of the entire New England region. Such is the historical import that was begun on October 11, 1992 at 9:30 AM, the fruition of a puritan's dream, the consummation of a puritan's printing. And yet by far the greater import of what began in 1991 is the materialization of a \"Total Christ\" vision for the mediatorial presence of Christ in greater New Haven and throughout the world. Described as the \"pillar and bulwark of the church\" in 1 Timothy 3:15, and the \"dwelling place of God\" in Ephesians 2:22, as long as CPC is faithful to \"Christ first\" - not merely a campaign slogan or a sentimental thought, but a principle in how to interpret the scripture and the substance that informs everything the church does and how she does it - we are assured that even the \"gates of hell will not prevail against her.\" (Mt 16) And as far back as the Acts of the Apostles, history has shown that the best way to reach new generations, new residents and new people groups for the Gospel of Jesus Christ is quite simply to get people to the person of Christ himself! At Mission Anabaino, we believe that during Christ's ascension ministry today, Christ has an address at every place where there is an apostolic, Christ-centered church. T. F. Torrance in Royal Priesthood explained it like this: The Spirit operates by creating out of the word a body, which St. Paul calls the Body of Christ…. As such this body becomes matched to Christ as His vis-à-vis in history and as the instrument of His saving purpose in the Gospel. It is the sphere where through the presence of the Spirit the salvation-events of the birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension are operative here and now in history, the sphere where within the old creation the new creation has broken in with power.

The very gospel that sets us free from the fear of divine and human condemnation is the same power that transforms our relationships, work, and worship. Biblical discipleship, including word, worship, and fellowship, exists at CPC primarily through Sunday worship, courses offered through the School of Discipleship, and Men's and Women's Discipleship Groups. We encourage all congregation members to participate in both a Life Group and a Discipleship Group. Although there are components of study in each Discipleship Group, their focus is on living and sharing truth through mutual accountability, study, and prayer.

Take the first step towards deeper community and spiritual growth. Get Started with Groups Learn More About Groups Ministries Children Youth Undergraduate Graduate Mercy Men Women Children In an attempt to assist our covenant families in raising their children in the grace of the gospel, we have developed a thoughtful and comprehensive approach towards providing your children with deep and enduring roots in the Christian faith. Our philosophy emphasizes close parent/church cooperation. As a result, our strategy for \"making disciples\" seeks to be primarily relational rather than programmatic. Our curriculum represents both a deductive and inductive approach to education that is intended to give our children a lasting and full knowledge of the Christian faith. Our goal, then, is to help our children become faithful disciples of Christ, well prepared to live and defend the Gospel into the 21st century. By the time a child leaves their home, they will have been trained in: Youth Our youth ministry at CPC is the capstone of our broader children's ministry, and targets both junior and senior high. We have many various goings-on throughout the year, but here are some of the offerings we have for our youth: Sunday School: CPC's Sunday School program goes from preschool through graduation. Our goal is to partner with parents in the Christian discipleship of their kids, in order that our kids ultimately embrace the gospel of grace for themselves. One-On-One Discipleship: Beyond our calendar events, we seek to schedule one-on-one time with students for discipleship. This takes the form of going out for lunch, monthly fellowship gatherings, ice cream, or anything that gives us an opportunity to deepen relationships and minister to the students' needs. For any inquiries regarding our youth ministry, contact Jerry Ornelas Undergraduate CPC's college ministry is a collection of students from wide-ranging backgrounds gathered under the banner of Jesus Christ. Mostly made up of Yale, Southern (SCSU) and Gateway students, the college ministry also includes students from other area universities. CPC seeks to help students love Christ, love the church, and love the campus life to which they are called. Because we love the campus, we send campus ministers to the campus, but above all, we invite students to take part in the fullness of Christ through CPC's rich, communal Sunday morning worship. Students, please honor us with your presence and unique gifts! One-on-One and Small Group Discipleship Depending on the needs of the students or campus, we are also deeply committed to individual and small group discipleship on campus. This has been happening at Yale and Southern, and we look to serve students of all local campuses (Quinnipiac, Gateway, and Albertus Magnus) in the future. For any inquiries regarding our Undergraduate ministry, contact Jerry Ornelas Bridging the Church-Campus Gap This is our internship program for college students interested in learning more, investing more, being more knit in to the family of God. It is a great opportunity to serve, receive valuable theological training, and have practical experiences and opportunities within the church.

Pastor's Book Pick You Are Not Your Own: Belonging to God in an Inhuman World by Alan Noble This book examines many of the ways in which our culture reinforces the lie that we belong to ourselves, and then provides a road map to avoid falling into sinful traps. Written by English professor and PCA church member Alan Noble, it points out the cultural and technological habits we all form, and then encourages us to fight against them, armed with the gospel-centered truth that we actually belong to God. Noble is a clear and witty writer, with the ability to see through deeply ingrained sinful habits, giving us hope and liberation for a more godly lifestyle. Copies are in the foyer, please pay $ what you can. Parent's Book Pick God Made Me for Worship: Helping Children Understand Church by Jared Kennedy Worship is what we were made for—and that includes our kids! Teaching them to sit through and take part in worship isn't always easy, but it's such a beautiful journey as we watch them grow in the same faith we hold dear. This is a great resource to help little ones see what's really happening during a church service.

Mercy Fund Application The primary and first level of mercy assistance begins at the small group level where needs are most readily discerned and the individual dynamics understood in coordination with the small group coordinator. When assistance exceeds the ability of the small group, then the small group coordinator contacts the CPC Mercy coordinator who will consult with the Sr. Pastor and develop a plan for addressing the need. In the case of financial assistance, this application should be filled out and returned to our administrator. Or you may submit the application through an online form here . Life Event Support Initiative As the body of Christ, we desire to support members during major life transitions or events in ways consistent with being the family of God. Showering members with prayer in contexts of communal celebrations or grieving can be a great blessing, witness, and support to members in a way that makes tangible Christ's promise \"I will never leave you nor forsake you\" (Heb.13:5). During Christ's ascension ministry, we know that this promise is no less true given Christ's presence as mediated through the body of Christ on earth that renders the words of Christ in Matthew just prior to his ascension all the more realistic, \"Behold, I am with you until the end of the age\" (Mt 28:20). To learn more, refer to section 7.9 in the Leadership Handbook below. Leadership Handbook The Leadership Handbook provides information related to leadership including CPC policies and expectations.

A vow is a \"confession\" regarding one's participation in a given institution, typically used in three divinely sanctioned institutions: the church, the state, and the family. According to Romans 10:9, one becomes a Christian when \"you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead.\" This confession, along with the elders' responsibility to \"watch over the flock of God,\" forms the foundation of church membership. Church membership is a good thing - it sets people apart into a special relationship with each other, where terms are clear and loyalties for mutual benefit are expressed and preserved. It's simply saying: \"I confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to enjoy the mutual support of one another.\" Contact Us About Membership Ready to take the next step?

Our Total Christ Spirituality We want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory, not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ. The term \"Total Christ\" originates from the 5th-century pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present) as \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body.\" The Five Marks 1. Gospel-Centered: Trust in the gospel motivates us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin because it's based in God's power! This grounds us in God's finished work on the cross, where he forgave our sins and reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is motivated from and by the gospel. Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire to be truly known and loved by God and others 2. Missional: More (though not less!) than being evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages, and demographics through the church. This grounds us in God's global presence, where the church is the evangelist for a whole new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him in all our relationships. Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful, holistic evangelismsafe 3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet: We are not the first ones to consider what church should be (thank God!). We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe to the documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of our faith. This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still speaks. Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness to be distracted by cultural fads 4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest: We desire an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein Christ our Priest is \"fleshed out\" in a carefully designed four movement worship service that follows the four movements of the gospel and culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion with Christ as \"fleshed out\" in cultural styles specific to each local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)! Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious 5. Communal - Christ as our King: Christ did not leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community. Many of us experience Christ first through the love of his body. We also take church government as an instrument of mercy seriously. This grounds us in Christ as our King. Think: loving, humble, one-anotherings Our Commitments We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A community united in the love of Jesus changes lives and communities. We hope that Sunday worship is the touchstone of our lives and that it bleeds into how we treat each other inside and outside of the church. Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian - or even Christian - so please feel comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to be a community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and have the privilege to embody it in the church. Our Five Basic Commitments 1. Scripture - We are committed to the Old and New Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice. While believing that God powerfully manifests his infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian faith and practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's word, not adding to, or subtracting from, anything contained within it, recognizing no other source for divine revelation, whether by ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations. WHY SHOULD I CARE? To liberate all of us from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel against manipulation and self-serving abuses. We want the God of grace and glory to be our only Lord.

We cannot experience God and grow spiritually in a truly gospel-centered and biblical way if we are living in isolation. Neither can we say we are flourishing if our brother or sister in Christ is suffering. Life Groups are our way of doing church in the small—with prayer, teaching, fellowship, and care—helping participants experience Christ outside of our worship gatherings. Discipleship Groups Christian discipleship applies the gospel to every aspect of life. Our Discipleship Groups focus on living and sharing truth through accountability, study, and prayer. Ministries Children We partner with covenant families to raise children rooted in the grace of the gospel. Our comprehensive curriculum builds deep, enduring Christian faith. Youth Our youth ministry is the capstone of our children’s ministry, offering programs that include Sunday School and one-on-one discipleship opportunities. Undergraduate Our college ministry gathers students from local universities to love Christ, love the church, and engage in communal worship. Graduate Designed for post-college members, our Graduate group fosters deeper spiritual growth and community involvement. Mercy Mercy begins within our Life Groups and extends to the whole church body, ensuring practical support and compassionate care. Men Our Men's Ministry offers opportunities for fellowship, spiritual growth, and outreach to unbelievers. Women Encouraging a gospel-centered lifestyle, our Women's Ministry provides a supportive environment for growth and connection. Membership Membership is more than a label—it defines our mutual commitment and accountability. By confessing our faith, we bind ourselves together as a supportive community.

Craig Luekens - Senior Pastor at CPC New Haven. Learn more about his journey and ministry.","headings":["Rev. Craig Luekens","Senior Pastor"],"text":"Home Sundays About Podcasts Events Announcements Community Live Resources Give Rev. Craig Luekens Senior Pastor Craig was born and raised in Indianapolis, IN, and was brought up in the Jewish faith through high school. In college - at Indiana University - he began asking deeper, more existential questions about purpose, meaning, and the existence of God. At the start of Sophomore year he committed his life to Christ. Having become convinced of the truth of Scripture, the Spirit convicted him that Jesus alone demands and deserves everything. In hopes of pursuing an academic career, he attended Yale Divinity School, completing a MDiv in 2008. God drew him to Christ Presbyterian Church and eventually to the ministry through CPC, where he also began work with Athletes in Action at Yale, a sports ministry for undergrad student-athletes. Craig was ordained as a Teaching Elder in the PCA in 2012 and completed a ThM in 2014 at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary in Biblical Theology. Having begun his role as Senior Pastor in 2023, his primary responsibilities include preaching, teaching, pastoral counseling, and moderating the Session/WLB (Shepherd Leaders) and Servant Leadership Boards. Craig has three kids - Charlotte (b. 2009); Julian (b. 2011); and Eli (b.2014) - from a previous marriage. He and Allison were married in 2021. Craig was a semi-professional cyclist before pursuing the ministry and always seeks more ways to merge his two loves as much as he can - discussing a good book on a good ride.","category":"About","updated":"2025-06-14"},{"url":"pastor-jerry.html","title":"Rev.

Jerry Ornelas","Assistant Pastor"],"text":"Home Sundays About Podcasts Events Announcements Community Live Resources Give Rev. Jerry Ornelas Assistant Pastor Jerry was born in Pasadena, California. At nine years of age he and his family moved to Savannah Georgia where he spent the majority of his formative years. Being a high school football player offered him the opportunity to play at the college level at Trinity International in Deerfield, Illinois. After several injuries the Lord providentially took away the desire to play football and replaced it with a desire for ministry. After years of wrestling with whether or not he should pursue vocational ministry the Lord sent him to Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi to pursue a Masters of Divinity. During his four years of training he spent the summer of 2018 interning at Christ Presbyterian Church. This eventually, in God's providence, turned into a call to serve as an Assistant Pastor as well as starting a college ministry at Southern Connecticut State University. Some of his passions are: traveling, spending time in nature such as hiking, kayaking and camping. Reading fiction and non-fiction, theology, philosophy, apologetics and science books are a joy and a delight to him. Using these various genres, along with sports and nature are tools he uses to disciple and point people to Jesus Christ.","category":"About","updated":"2025-06-14"},{"url":"podcasts.html","title":"Podcasts - CPC New Haven Church","description":"CPC New Haven Church - Podcast Archive.

(WCF 1.4) Concerning Usability: …[That] in a due use of the ordinary means, [we] may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them. (WCF 1.5) [Wherein] the whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.

Our method is confessional. The confessional method is distinguished from systematic, historical, philosophical, or even social theologies, if also sharing in some elements inherent to each of them. It is at the end an exercise of faith formation that will consider the related topics as from the vantage point of divine revelation intended for people of faith. It therefore involves reading the bible communally as revealed not only to individuals, but to that organic body of Christ described as the “pillar and bulwark of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). Such communal interpretation has the advantage of transcending any one geo-political/historical expression. It is an attempt to understand God’s revelation in scripture aided by that consensus of the church across the ages. Our primary source will be within Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF), one historical expression of the catholic faith. A secondary aim of this course is to satisfy one of the prerequisite courses toward becoming a CPC Sunday school teacher, community/discipleship group facilitator, elder, and women's leadership board member. 1.

How should I treat my neighbor? What does the Bible say about social justice, adultery, covetousness, or slander? Does the Sabbath matter anymore? To answer these questions and more, this year we're \"Walking with Jesus Thru Sinai.\" More than a badge to prove our self-righteousness or a burden to leave us in guilt, the 10 Commandments are summaries of what a flourishing life before God is meant to look like. It shows us how we are made and how we ought to live. This class will be an opportunity to discuss all sorts of crucial issues, from idolatry and worship to moral virtues and political beliefs. Grounded in the grace of Christ, the law becomes a beautiful vision for all our lives. All are welcome! We meet in the Fellowship Hall. 1. Christ & the Law Listen - Handout 2.
