      "zAspiring to be a gospel centered community, we talk a lot about making this a \"safe place\" for real-time sinful people to be in journey with Christ. There is no limit to God's grace as accomplished for us by Christ. And aspiring to not just learn about Christ and the good news of the gospel we talk a lot about participating in Christ's presence. We do this both in the mystery of \"one-anothering\" in the power of the Holy Spirit, and in the mystery of sacramental worship wherein we \"do\" the gospel in the ancient temple pattern of four movements. Through it all, Christ is in the midst of us by the Holy Spirit as our prophet, priest and king! So I hope you will join us and enjoy our journey together in Christ.",
      "We want to connect with you so please take the time to fill out a Welcome Card located in the pews and place it in the offering basket or return it to the Welcome Table. You may also include a prayer request on the reverse side. Your requests are prayed for during the week. Also, visit the Welcome Table for a Welcome Brochure!",
      "We value families worshiping together and welcome children of all ages to join us in worship at their parents’ discretion (see the booklet “Together in God’s Presence” at the children’s ministry table). Childcare is available for parents who wish to take advantage of it. Look for this icon in the bulletin to know when to drop off and pick up your children. Supplementary children’s sermon material is available in the foyer",
      "We highly recommend that you participate bodily in worship, however, when necessity or mercy requires, you may access a live stream video of our full service at cpcnewhaven.org/live. You may also view a recorded version or listen to our sermons at podcasts.cpcnewhaven.org. We do believe that there is a mystical communion of Christ in heaven with the body of Christ on earth by the Holy Spirit when you participate in person in worship."
