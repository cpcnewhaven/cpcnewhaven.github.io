      "Aspiring to be a gospel centered community, we talk a lot about making this a \"safe place\" for real-time sinful people to be in journey with Christ. There is no limit to God's grace as accomplished for us by Christ. And aspiring to not just learn about Christ and the good news of the gospel we talk a lot about participating in Christ's presence. We do this both in the mystery of \"one-anothering\" in the power of the Holy Spirit, and in the mystery of sacramental worship wherein we \"do\" the gospel in the ancient temple pattern of four movements. Through it all, Christ is in the midst of us by the Holy Spirit as our prophet, priest and king! So I hope you will join us and enjoy our journey together in Christ."
