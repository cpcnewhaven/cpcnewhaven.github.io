                                    Our
                                    philosophy emphasizes close parent/church
                                    cooperation. As a result, our strategy for
                                    "making disciples" seeks to be primarily
                                    relational
                                    rather than programmatic.

                                    Imprisoned and faced with the ultimate cost
                                    of
                                    Christian discipleship, John the Baptist
                                    sent his
                                    disciples to inquire of Jesus, "Are you the
                                    one who
                                    is to come or shall we look for another?"
                                    When
                                    John's disciples found Jesus, his answer was

                                    relevant then as it is today. Busy healing

                                    invoked the expectations of the prophets as
                                    validation of his messianic authenticity.
                                    Go and tell John what you have seen and
                                    heard: the
                                    blind receive their sight, the lame walk,

                                    the poor have good news preached to them.

                                    the fullness of the image of God expressed
                                    in both
                                    men and women, as they work in partnership
                                    with one
                                    another for the glory of God. Women's events
                                    seek to
                                    minister to women in their various phases
                                    and
                                    spheres of life.

                            Throughout history, special relationships have been
                            set apart by the taking of vows. What exactly is a
                            vow? A vow is a
                            "confession" regarding the meaning of one's
                            participation in a given institution. Therefore,
                            vows are ordinarily limited
                            to initiation ceremonies. And according to the
                            Bible, there are three such institutions that enjoy
                            divine
                            sanction--the church, the state, and the family.
                            Vows are used to initiate a church relationship, or
                            perhaps one's
                            service in an office of the church.

                        <p class="body-text">
                            According to the apostle Paul, one becomes a
                            Christian when "you confess with your lips that
                            Jesus is Lord, and believe
                            in your heart that God raised him from the dead"
                            (Romans 10:9). Who are we "confessing" to with our
                            lips and in what
                            context? Related to this, what else could it mean
                            for the elders to "watch over the flock of God" if
                            not a flock that
                            can be defined by some "initiation" ceremony in
                            relation to the exchange of vows? Or, in the words
                            of Hebrews, what
                            else could it mean to "obey your leaders and submit
                            to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls
                            and will give
                            an account," apart from some willing and voluntary
                            way to form an association that is predicated upon
                            the taking of
                            vows one to another? (see 1 Peter 5, Hebrews 13:17).
                            And when the church is exhorted to
                            "remove such a one" from "the
                            assembly" as the ultimate, albeit tragic, expression
                            of church discipline, what else could it mean except
                            that the
                            person was joined to the assembly by some confession
                            that is later deemed broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5).
                            Or, when we
                            are exhorted to support one another even through our
                            financial means, how could such benefits be
                            distributed except
                            that it means something to bind one's self to
                            another through the authenticating protections of an
                            initiation
                            ceremony? (2 Corinthians 8).

                            And so, for these abbreviated reasons, we believe
                            that church membership is a good thing given by God.
                            When one becomes
                            a Christian, they gain a heavenly Father and new
                            brothers and sisters! It sets people apart into a
                            special relationship
                            with each other, where the terms are clear and where
                            loyalties for the mutual benefit of all are
                            expressed and
                            preserved. Membership is simply a way to say: "I
                            confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to
                            enjoy the mutual
                            support of one another until, for whatever reason,
                            someone is led elsewhere."
