                        God's people are the hands and feet of Christ. We cannot

                        others is where we find life.

                            In an attempt to assist our covenant families in
                            raising their children in the grace of the gospel,
                            we have developed a thoughtful and comprehensive
                            approach towards providing your children with deep
                            and enduring roots in the Christian faith. Our
                            philosophy emphasizes close parent/church
                            cooperation. As a result, our strategy for
                            "making disciples" seeks to be primarily relational
                            rather than programmatic.

                            give our children a lasting and full knowledge of
                            the Christian faith. Our goal, then, is to help our
                            children become faithful disciples of Christ, well

                            CPC's college ministry is a collection of students

                            banner of Jesus Christ. Mostly made up of Yale,
                            Southern (SCSU) and Gateway students, the college
                            ministry also includes students from other area
                            universities.
                            CPC seeks to help students love Christ, love the
                            church, and love the campus life to which they are
                            called. Because we love the campus, we send campus
                            ministers to the campus, but above all, we invite
                            students to take part in the fullness of Christ
                            through CPC's rich, communal Sunday morning worship.

                            interested in learning more, investing more, being
                            more knit in to the family of God. It is a great
                            opportunity to serve, receive valuable theological
                            training, and have practical experiences and
                            opportunities within the church. Go here for more

                            <strong>Athletes in Action</strong><br>
                            CPC supports several on-campus ministries at Yale
                            including Athletes in Action: One World To Reach,
                            One Language of Sport, One Message of Victory.
                            Athletes in Action is a student-led sports ministry
                            dedicated to building a community of fellowship
                            founded in the loving character of Jesus Christ. We
                            seek to reach out to students through large group
                            meetings, fun activities, and individual
                            connections. We welcome people of all backgrounds to
                            explore the Christian faith. We meet weekly during
                            the academic year and have Bible studies throughout
                            the week, fellowship activities, and retreats
                            throughout the year.

                            In many areas of campus, like the med school, law

                            Our church is blessed to have congregants in many
                            fields that Graduates will enter, so these seminars

                            relationships, fostering a biblical worldview that
                            is vocation-specific, and encouraging students on

                            THE QUESTION ANSWERED THEN AND NOW
                            Imprisoned and faced with the ultimate cost of
                            Christian discipleship, John the Baptist sent his
                            disciples to inquire of Jesus, "Are you the one who
                            is to come or shall we look for another?" When
                            John's disciples found Jesus, his answer was as
                            relevant then as it is today. Busy healing the sick,
                            giving sight to the blind and casting out evil
                            influences to those who were hopeless, Christ
                            invoked the expectations of the prophets as
                            validation of his messianic authenticity.
                            Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the
                            blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are
                            cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up,
                            the poor have good news preached to them. (Luke
                            7:22, cf. Isaiah 35:5f, 61:1)
                            John's question then is no less a question often
                            raised today by the faithful and cynic alike. Are
                            you (the body of Christ) legit? CPC envisions the
                            embodiment of the same response of doing mercy under
                            the power of Christ's ascension ministry today, both
                            in word and deed, as validation to the relevancy and
                            power of Jesus Christ in our midst.
                            As concerns the sacred "family of God," we discern
                            in Galatians 6:10, that along with the mandate to
                            "do good to all" commanded of all Christians, there
                            is the all-important adage, "and especially the
                            household of faith" enjoined upon the local church
                            especially. The biblical mandate to take care of one
                            another in the family of God is both to preserve
                            authentic and holistic love and effective witness.
                            By this all will know that you are My disciples, if
                            you have love for one another. (John 13:34-35)
                            With these and other passages in mind, our church
                            consensus concerning our privilege and duty to love
                            one another in both inward and outward ways is
                            summarized in our historic consensus of what the
                            scriptures principally teach:
                            All saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their
                            head, by his Spirit, and by faith, have fellowship
                            with him in his graces, sufferings, death,
                            resurrection, and glory: and, being united to one
                            another in love, they have communion in each other's
                            gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance
                            of such duties, public and private, as do conduce to
                            their mutual good, both in the inward and outward
                            man. (Westminster Confession of Faith *Chapter 26
                            section 1)

                            At CPC, participating in mercy begins with actively
                            participating in one of our many Life Groups within
                            and around greater New Haven. Each life group is as
                            a "church in miniature" wherein we are each "seen"
                            and "known" so that just "one-anothering" at a more
                            intimate level facilitates mercy with and for one
                            another often before a situation reaches a crisis.
                            Each Life Group is assigned a trained Life Group
                            Mercy Coordinator to assist each group's care for
                            one another as needs arise. This care includes
                            sharing in prayer, emotional and spiritual support,
                            and tangible assistance as needed. If you are
                            interested in doing and/or receiving mercy in an
                            authentic and holistic way, start by joining a life
                            group.

                            And they were selling their possessions and

                            ideally originates from the potential recipient,

                            MERCY PROJECT AND IMPACT WEEK
                            One form of helping meet the outward needs of a
                            person can be in the form of seeking assistance for
                            projects that might not always require financial
                            assistance but the "know-how" of someone in the
                            congregation. A Mercy project can range from seeking
                            help in financial planning, ride to the doctor, a
                            home repair project, etc. Again, the first step
                            would be to seek the assistance of your Life Group
                            Mercy Coordinator. In the event that the Life Group
                            needs the assistance of the greater Church, the CPC
                            Mercy Coordinator is contacted wherein the full
                            gifts and vocations of the body of Christ can be
                            accessed. We also encourage everyone in the church
                            to "tithe" a day or two vacation and participate in
                            our annual Impact Week and the opportunity to do
                            Mercy through Youth Camp and Mercy Projects
                            throughout the city.

                            The mission of CPC's Men's Ministry is to provide
                            all men the opportunity to experience genuine
                            Christian fellowship, build strong friendships, grow
                            spiritually, and reach unbelieving friends. Through
                            these opportunities, men will increasingly
                            experience the transformative power of the Gospel of
                            Jesus Christ in all spheres of their lives to the
                            glory of God.

                            Women at CPC are encouraged to live their lives in a
                            gospel-centered (missional, sacramental,
                            confessional, and communal) manner. We hope to see
                            the fullness of the image of God expressed in both
                            men and women, as they work in partnership with one
                            another for the glory of God. Women's events seek to
                            minister to women in their various phases and
                            spheres of life.

                <section class="inner-page-section" id="membership">
                    <h2 class="heading-2">Membership</h2>
                    <p class="body-text">Throughout history, special
                        relationships have been set apart by the taking of vows.
                        What exactly is a vow? A vow is a "confession" regarding
                        the meaning of one's participation in a given
                        institution. Therefore, vows are ordinarily limited to
                        initiation ceremonies. And according to the Bible, there
                        are three such institutions that enjoy divine
                        sanction--the church, the state, and the family. Vows
                        are used to initiate a church relationship, or perhaps
                        one's service in an office of the church.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">According to the apostle Paul, one
                        becomes a Christian when "you confess with your lips
                        that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God
                        raised him from the dead" (Romans 10:9). Who are we
                        "confessing" to with our lips and in what context?
                        Related to this, what else could it mean for the elders
                        to "watch over the flock of God" if not a flock that can
                        be defined by some "initiation" ceremony in relation to
                        the exchange of vows? Or, in the words of Hebrews, what
                        else could it mean to "obey your leaders and submit to
                        them, for they are keeping watch over your souls and
                        will give an account," apart from some willing and
                        voluntary way to form an association that is predicated
                        upon the taking of vows one to another? (see 1 Peter 5,
                        Hebrews 13:17). And when the church is exhorted to
                        "remove such a one" from "the assembly" as the ultimate,
                        albeit tragic, expression of church discipline, what
                        else could it mean except that the person was joined to
                        the assembly by some confession that is later deemed
                        broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5). Or, when we are exhorted
                        to support one another even through our financial means,
                        how could such benefits be distributed except that it
                        means something to bind one's self to another through
                        the authenticating protections of an initiation
                        ceremony? (2 Corinthians 8).
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">And so, for these abbreviated reasons,
                        we believe that church membership is a good thing given
                        by God. When one becomes a Christian, they gain a
                        heavenly Father and new brothers and sisters! It sets
                        people apart into a special relationship with each
                        other, where the terms are clear and where loyalties for
                        the mutual benefit of all are expressed and preserved.
                        Membership is simply a way to say: "I confess my faith
                        in solidarity with you so as to enjoy the mutual support
                        of one another until, for whatever reason, someone is
                        led elsewhere."
