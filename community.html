We cannot experience God and grow spiritually in a truly gospel-centered and biblical way if we are living in isolation. Neither can we say we are flourishing if our brother or sister in Christ is suffering. Bound together with covenant communion, God brings us into new relationships where sacrifice is freedom and giving to others is where we find life.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text">Life Groups are our way of doing church in the small with all sorts of people engaged in prayer, teaching, fellowship and care. They are the vehicle that we use to help its participants continue to experience Christ outside of our worship gatherings and to impart the pastoral care that Christ provides through the love of His people. Thus, the worship, teaching, fellowship, and care for one another supply a more intimate and hands-on encounter with the living Christ.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Christian discipleship is the application of the gospel to every aspect of life. The very gospel that sets us free from the fear of divine and human condemnation is the same power that transforms our relationships, work, and worship. Biblical discipleship, including word, worship, and fellowship, exists at CPC primarily through Sunday worship, courses offered through the School of Discipleship, and Men's and Women's Discipleship Groups.</p>
                
                <p class="body-text">We encourage all congregation members to participate in both a Life Group and a Discipleship Group. Although there are components of study in each Discipleship Group, their focus is on living and sharing truth through mutual accountability, study, and prayer.</p>

                    In an attempt to assist our covenant families in
                    raising their children in the grace of the gospel,
                    we have developed a thoughtful and comprehensive
                    approach towards providing your children with deep
                    and enduring roots in the Christian faith. Our
                    philosophy emphasizes close parent/church
                    cooperation. As a result, our strategy for
                    "making disciples" seeks to be primarily relational
                    rather than programmatic.

                    Our curriculum represents both a deductive and

                    give our children a lasting and full knowledge of
                    the Christian faith. Our goal, then, is to help our
                    children become faithful disciples of Christ, well
                    prepared to live and defend the Gospel into the 21st

                    CPC's college ministry is a collection of students
                    from wide-ranging backgrounds gathered under the
                    banner of Jesus Christ. Mostly made up of Yale,
                    Southern (SCSU) and Gateway students, the college
                    ministry also includes students from other area
                    universities.
                    CPC seeks to help students love Christ, love the

                <span>MERCY BEGINS WITH PARTICIPATING IN A LIFE
                    GROUP</span>
                At CPC, participating in mercy begins with actively
                participating in one of our many Life Groups within
                and around greater New Haven. Each life group is as
                a "church in miniature" where we are each "seen"
                and "known" at a more
                intimate level facilitates mercy with and for one
                another often before a situation reaches a crisis.
                Each Life Group is assigned a trained Life Group
                Mercy Coordinator to assist each group's care for
                one another as needs arise. This care includes
                sharing in prayer, emotional and spiritual support,
                and tangible assistance as needed. If you are
                interested in doing and/or receiving mercy in an
                authentic and holistic way, start by <a href="lifegroup.html"

                As needs become greater than can be dealt with at
                the Life Group level, or the need for a special
                expertise or asset not represented in the group is

                CPC body of Christ is made available. This is
                coordinated by the CPC Mercy Coordinator with the
                assistance and oversight of the Sr. Pastor. The CPC
                Coordinator works with the CPC Mercy Team consisting
                of CPC Life Coordinators and other select persons
                with skills or training relevant to the kinds of
                mercy needs that arise. This team meets quarterly or
                as needed to review the needs of the body of Christ
                and make recommendations to the Servant Leader Board
                and/or CPC Shepherds as needed.

                <span>IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE?</span>
                The CPC Mercy Fund is financed by our annual
                designated Christmas offering. We encourage all of
                our members and regular attenders to participate in
                this fund in the spirit of Acts 2:44-45: And all who
                believed were together and had all things in common.
                And they were selling their possessions and
                belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as
                any had need.
                The process for applying for financial assistance
                ideally originates from the potential recipient,
                assisted by his/her Life Group Mercy Coordinator,
                filling out the CPC Mercy Fund application. Once the
                application is filled out, the two will then contact
                the CPC Mercy Coordinator who will in turn review
                with Sr. Pastor, and as needed other relevant
                members of the Mercy Team, toward presenting the
                request for approval by the Shepherd Leader Board.
                Those qualified to receive financial assistance must
                fulfill the following criteria:
                Complete Financial Mercy Fund Application; be
                a member in good standing of CPC New Haven (some
                exceptions can be made by those who are in process
                of becoming a member as a regular attender.)
                The recipient must agree to actively participate in
                a CPC Life Group.

                <span>MERCY PROJECT</span>
                One form of helping meet the outward needs of a
                person can be in the form of seeking assistance for
                projects that might not always require financial
                assistance but the "know-how" of someone in the
                congregation. A Mercy project can range from seeking
                help in financial planning, ride to the doctor, a
                home repair project, etc. Again, the first step
                would be to seek the assistance of your Life Group
                Mercy Coordinator. In the event that the Life Group
                needs the assistance of the greater Church, the CPC
                Mercy Coordinator is contacted wherein the full
                gifts and vocations of the body of Christ can be
                accessed. We also encourage everyone in the church
                to "tithe" a day or two vacation and participate in
                an opportunity to do
                Mercy through Youth Camp and Mercy Projects
                throughout the city.

            <h2>Membership</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, special relationships have been set apart
                by the taking of vows. What exactly is a vow? A vow is a
                "confession" regarding the meaning of ones participation in
                a given institution. Therefore, vows are ordinarily limited
                to initiation ceremonies. And according to the Bible, there
                are three such institutions that enjoy a divine
                sanction--the church, the state and the family. For
                instance, vows are used to initiate a judicial proceeding or
                even citizenship in the civil sphere. Vows are used to
                initiate a family relationship between a husband and wife in
                the family sphere. And, for those who believe that the
                church is a third institution set apart by God, vows are
                used to initiate a church relationship, or perhaps one's
                service in an office of the church. And would it surprise
                you that every one of the above examples can be located in
                the Bible? We will review briefly the biblical rationale
                that relates to the taking of vows in the church sphere.</p>
            <p>According to the apostle Paul, one becomes a Christian when
                "you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord, and believe
                in your heart that God raised him from the dead" (Romans
                10:9). Who are we "confessing" to with our lips and in what
                context? Related to this, what else could it mean for the
                elders to "watch over the flock of God" if not a flock that
                can be defined by some "initiation" ceremony in relation to
                the exchange of vows? Or, in the words of Hebrews, what else
                could it mean to "obey your leaders and submit to them, for
                they are keeping watch over your souls and will give an
                account," apart from some willing and voluntary way to form
                an association that is predicated upon the taking of vows
                one to another? (see 1 Peter 5, Hebrews 13:17). And when the
                church is exhorted to "remove such a one" from "the
                assembly" as the ultimate, albeit tragic, expression of
                church discipline, what else could it mean except that the
                person was joined to the assembly by some confession that is
                later deemed broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5). Or, when we are
                exhorted to support one another even through our financial
                means, how could such benefits be distributed except that it
                means something to bind one's self to another through the
                authenticating protections of an initiation ceremony? (2
                Corinthians 8).</p>
            <p>And so, for these abbreviated reasons, we believe that church
                membership as a good thing. It sets people apart into a
                special relationship with each other, where the terms are
                clear and where loyalties for the mutual benefit of all are
                expressed and preserved. Membership is simply a way to say:
                "I confess my faith in solidarity with you so as to enjoy
                the mutual support of one another until, for whatever
                reason, someone is led elsewhere."</p>
