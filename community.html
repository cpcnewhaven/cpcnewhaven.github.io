                    <p class="body-text">Throughout history, special
                        relationships have been set apart by the taking of vows.
                        What exactly is a vow? A vow is a “confession” regarding
                        the meaning of one's participation in a given
                        institution. Therefore, vows are ordinarily limited to
                        initiation ceremonies. And according to the Bible, there
                        are three such institutions that enjoy divine
                        sanction--the church, the state, and the family. Vows
                        are used to initiate a church relationship, or perhaps
                        one’s service in an office of the church.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">According to the apostle Paul, one
                        becomes a Christian when “you confess with your lips
                        that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God
                        raised him from the dead” (Romans 10:9). Who are we
                        “confessing” to with our lips and in what context?
                        Related to this, what else could it mean for the elders
                        to “watch over the flock of God” if not a flock that can
                        be defined by some “initiation” ceremony in relation to
                        the exchange of vows? Or, in the words of Hebrews, what
                        else could it mean to “obey your leaders and submit to
                        them, for they are keeping watch over your souls and
                        will give an account,” apart from some willing and
                        voluntary way to form an association that is predicated
                        upon the taking of vows one to another? (see 1 Peter 5,
                        Hebrews 13:17). And when the church is exhorted to
                        “remove such a one” from “the assembly” as the ultimate,
                        albeit tragic, expression of church discipline, what
                        else could it mean except that the person was joined to
                        the assembly by some confession that is later deemed
                        broken? (1 Corinthians 5:3-5). Or, when we are exhorted
                        to support one another even through our financial means,
                        how could such benefits be distributed except that it
                        means something to bind one’s self to another through
                        the authenticating protections of an initiation
                        ceremony? (2 Corinthians 8).
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">And so, for these abbreviated reasons,
                        we believe that church membership is a good thing given
                        by God. When one becomes a Christian, they gain a
                        heavenly Father and new brothers and sisters! It sets
                        people apart into a special relationship with each
                        other, where the terms are clear and where loyalties for
                        the mutual benefit of all are expressed and preserved.
                        Membership is simply a way to say: “I confess my faith
                        in solidarity with you so as to enjoy the mutual support
                        of one another until, for whatever reason, someone is
                        led elsewhere.”
