            "God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together." - 1 Corinthians 12:24-26
            
            God's people are the hands and feet of Christ. We cannot experience God and grow spiritually in a truly gospel-centered and biblical way if we are living in isolation. Neither can we say we are flourishing if our brother or sister in Christ is suffering. Bound together with covenant communion, God brings us into new relationships where sacrifice is freedom and giving to others is where we find life.

            <p class="body-text">
                Discipleship Groups (D-Groups) are gender-specific groups of 3-4 people who meet weekly for intentional spiritual growth and accountability. These groups focus on Bible reading, prayer, and helping each other follow Jesus more closely in daily life. The smaller size allows for deeper sharing and more focused discipleship relationships. D-Groups typically meet for 12-18 months, working through Scripture and spiritual disciplines together. These groups provide a great opportunity for more mature believers to invest in younger believers, though anyone can benefit from participating. Contact the church office if you're interested in joining or starting a D-Group.

                    In an attempt to assist our covenant families in
                    raising their children in the grace of the gospel,
                    we have developed a thoughtful and comprehensive
                    approach towards providing your children with deep
                    and enduring roots in the Christian faith. Our
                    philosophy emphasizes close parent/church
                    cooperation. As a result, our strategy for
                    "making disciples" seeks to be primarily relational
                    rather than programmatic.

                <p class="body-text">
                    Our curriculum represents both a deductive and
                    inductive approach to education that is intended to
                    give our children a lasting and full knowledge of
                    the Christian faith. Our goal, then, is to help our
                    children become faithful disciples of Christ, well
                    prepared to live and defend the Gospel into the 21st
                    century.

                            banner of Jesus Christ. Mostly made up of Yale,

                            ministry also includes students from other area
                            universities.
                            CPC seeks to help students love Christ, love the
                            church, and love the campus life to which they are
                            called. Because we love the campus, we send campus
                            ministers to the campus, but above all, we invite
                            students to take part in the fullness of Christ through
                            CPC's rich, communal Sunday morning worship. Students,

                            Athletes in Action is a student-led sports ministry

                            founded in the loving character of Jesus Christ. We
                            seek to reach out to students through large group
                            meetings, fun activities, and individual

                    <span>THE QUESTION ANSWERED THEN AND NOW</span>
                    Imprisoned and faced with the ultimate cost of
                    Christian discipleship, John the Baptist sent his
                    disciples to inquire of Jesus, "Are you the one who
                    is to come or shall we look for another?" When
                    John's disciples found Jesus, his answer was as
                    relevant then as it is today. Busy healing the sick,
                    giving sight to the blind and casting out evil
                    influences to those who were hopeless, Christ
                    invoked the expectations of the prophets as
                    validation of his messianic authenticity.
                    Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the
                    blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are
                    cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up,
                    the poor have good news preached to them. <cite>(Luke
                        7:22, cf. Isaiah 35:5f, 61:1)</cite>
                    John's question then is no less a question often
                    raised today by the faithful and cynic alike. Are
                    you (the body of Christ) legit? CPC envisions the
                    embodiment of the same response of doing mercy under
                    the power of Christ's ascension ministry today, both
                    in word and deed, as validation to the relevancy and
                    power of Jesus Christ in our midst.
                    As concerns the sacred "family of God," we discern
                    in Galatians 6:10, that along with the mandate to
                    "do good to all" commanded of all Christians, there
                    is the all-important adage, "and especially the
                    household of faith" enjoined upon the local church.
                    The biblical mandate to take care of one
                    another in the family of God is both to preserve
                    authentic and holistic love and effective witness.
                    By this all will know that you are My disciples, if
                    you have love for one another. <cite>(John
                        13:34-35)</cite>
                    With these and other passages in mind, our privilege and
                    duty to love
                    one another in both inward and outward ways is
                    summarized in our historic confession of faith.
                    "All saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their
                    head, by his Spirit, and by faith, have fellowship
                    with him in his graces, sufferings, death,
                    resurrection, and glory: and, being united to one
                    another in love, they have communion in each other's
                    gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance
                    of such duties, public and private, as do conduce to
                    their mutual good, both in the inward and outward
                    man." <cite>(Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter
                        26,
                        section 1)</cite>

                        GROUP</span>
                    At CPC, participating in mercy begins with actively
                    participating in one of our many Life Groups within
                    and around greater New Haven. Each life group is as
                    a "church in miniature" where we are each "seen"
                    and "known" at a more
                    intimate level facilitates mercy with and for one
                    another often before a situation reaches a crisis.
                    Each Life Group is assigned a trained Life Group
                    Mercy Coordinator to assist each group's care for
                    one another as needs arise. This care includes
                    sharing in prayer, emotional and spiritual support,
                    and tangible assistance as needed. If you are

                    As needs become greater than can be dealt with at

                    coordinated by the CPC Mercy Coordinator with the
                    assistance and oversight of the Sr. Pastor. The CPC
                    Coordinator works with the CPC Mercy Team consisting
                    of CPC Life Coordinators and other select persons
                    with skills or training relevant to the kinds of
                    mercy needs that arise. This team meets quarterly or
                    as needed to review the needs of the body of Christ
                    and make recommendations to the Servant Leader Board
