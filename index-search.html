<!-- WELCOME SECTION -->
<section>
    <h1>New Haven, CT</h1>
    <p>As a church committed to Greater New Haven, we hope to serve and reach both downtown New Haven and the surrounding edge towns. We believe that the gospel transcends all ethnic, social, and demographic boundaries. We are ambitious for the glory of God and aim to extend a Christ-centered gospel throughout Greater New Haven.</p>
    <h1>Connect</h1>
    <p>We want to connect with you so please take the time to fill out a Welcome Card located in the pews and place it in the offering basket or return it to the Welcome Table. You may also include a prayer request on the reverse side. Your requests are prayed for during the week. Also, visit the Welcome Table for a Welcome Brochure!</p>
    <h1>Children</h1>
    <p>We value families worshiping together and welcome children of all ages to join us in worship at their parents’ discretion (see the booklet “Together in God’s Presence” at the children’s ministry table). Childcare is available for parents who wish to take advantage of it. Look for this icon in the bulletin to know when to drop off and pick up your children. Supplementary children’s sermon material is available in the foyer.</p>
    <h1>Parking</h1>
    <p>When parking on Sundays please reserve our parking lot for visitors, parents with small children, and those who need to park closer. Two Yale parking lots north of the church on Whitney Ave. are available to us also. Lot 16: Gibbs Lab at Whitney Ave. and Humphrey St., and the Whitney Ave. Garage located behind 221 Whitney Ave. For safety, exit our lot on the Bradley St. side only.</p>
    <h1>Worship</h1>
    <p>We highly recommend that you participate bodily in worship, however, when necessity or mercy requires, you may access a live stream video of our full service at <a href="cpcnewhaven.org/live">cpcnewhaven.org/live</a>. You may also view a recorded version or listen to our sermons at <a href="podcasts.cpcnewhaven.org">podcasts.cpcnewhaven.org</a>. We do believe that there is a mystical communion of Christ in heaven with the body of Christ on earth by the Holy Spirit when you participate in person in worship.</p>
