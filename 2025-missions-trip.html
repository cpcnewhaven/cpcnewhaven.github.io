                <p> Last spring, we convened a mission trip planning committee,
                    and after several meetings discussing vision, purpose, and a
                    number of different potential sites - both national and
                    international - we decided on New City Fellowship in

                    <p>If you are interested in joining us on this mission trip,
                        please email your interest to Alexis at
                        admin@cpcnewhaven.org. We look forward to serving

                    <p>Last spring, we convened a mission trip planning committee,
                        and after several meetings discussing vision, purpose, and a
                        number of different potential sites - both national and
                        international - we decided on New City Fellowship in
                        Atlantic City, NJ. They have a longstanding mission in the
                        inner city of Atlantic City, as part of a PCA church
                        planting network, and have hosted mission teams for many
                        years. We will be one of their “Urban Ministry Teams.” As
                        they describe it on their website
                        (https://www.mnashortterm.org/new-city-atlantic-city) “The
                        goal of Urban Ministry Teams is to assist in the evangelism
                        and development of selected Atlantic City neighborhoods and
                        to give your team a vision for racial reconciliation,
                        ministry to the poor, joy in worship and urban mercy
                        ministry that your team can replicate once they return
                        home.” Feel free to read more about the mission at the link
                        above. We believe this mission has the potential to impact
                        people’s lives immediately for the gospel, as well as give
                        us a vision and passion for mission in our own backyard. We
                        have reserved Aug. 2-9 (though we have time to move those
                        dates if enough people require a July week), so the team
                        will worship with them on Sunday Aug. 3.</p>
                    <p>Please join me in giving thanks and praise to God for our
                        planning committee team - Patty Chuchta, Meg Bogue, Blake
                        Boles, Natalie Billings, Karen Peck, Susan White, Allison
                        Luekens, Pastor Jerry, and myself.</p>
                    <p>May the Spirit continue to be at work in our church as we
                        seek to live out the wonderful news of the gospel and may we
                        be able to strive with Paul,
                        "that I may know Christ and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead."
                        (Phil. 3:10-11)</p>
