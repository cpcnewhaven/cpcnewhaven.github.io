                <h1>2025 Mission Trip</h1>
                <p>Greetings beloved brothers and sisters of CPC!</p>
                <p>As some of you know from our congregational meeting, we have
                    decided on where we want to go for our 2025 summer mission
                    trip, and I wanted to provide more details and next
                    steps.</p>
                <p>Last spring, we convened a mission trip planning committee,
                    and after several meetings discussing vision, purpose, and a
                    number of different potential sites - both national and
                    international - we decided on New City Fellowship in
                    Atlantic City, NJ. They have a longstanding mission in the
                    inner city of Atlantic City, as part of a PCA church
                    planting network, and have hosted mission teams for many
                    years. We will be one of their “Urban Ministry Teams.” As
                    they describe it on their website
                    (https://www.mnashortterm.org/new-city-atlantic-city) “The
                    goal of Urban Ministry Teams is to assist in the evangelism
                    and development of selected Atlantic City neighborhoods and
                    to give your team a vision for racial reconciliation,
                    ministry to the poor, joy in worship and urban mercy
                    ministry that your team can replicate once they return
                    home.” Feel free to read more about the mission at the link
                    above. We believe this mission has the potential to impact
                    people’s lives immediately for the gospel, as well as give
                    us a vision and passion for mission in our own backyard. We
                    have reserved Aug. 2-9 (though we have time to move those
                    dates if enough people require a July week), so the team
                    will worship with them on Sunday Aug. 3.</p>
                <p>Please join me in giving thanks and praise to God for our
                    planning committee team - Patty Chuchta, Meg Bogue, Blake
                    Boles, Natalie Billings, Karen Peck, Susan White, Allison
                    Luekens, Pastor Jerry, and myself.</p>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> one-week mission trip for all ages</p>
                <p><strong>Where:</strong> urban poor neighborhoods in Atlantic
                    City, NJ with New City Fellowship (newcityac.org)</p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> Aug. 2-9, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> to share the gospel, serve the poor,
                    grow in our love for Jesus and vision for missional
                    living</p>
                <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch video</li>
                    <li>Pray for the Spirit to increase in you a desire to see
                        the gospel go forth through our work.</li>
                    <li>Email your interest to Alexis - admin@cpcnewhaven.org.
                        This is not a commitment, just an expression of
                        interest.</li>
                    <li>Attend Informational Meeting Oct. 27 during lunch, after
                        worship - this is where we will field any questions you
                        may have, and begin to gather our team.</li>
                    <li>Begin meeting as a team - we will have periodic meetings
                        leading up to the trip, which will include vision
                        casting, training in urban ministry and racial
                        reconciliation, fundraising tips, prayer, and more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>May the Spirit continue to be at work in our church as we
                    seek to live out the wonderful news of the gospel and may we
                    be able to strive with Paul,
                    "that I may know Christ and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead."
                    (Phil. 3:10-11)</p>
                <p>Much love in Christ,<br>Craig</p>
