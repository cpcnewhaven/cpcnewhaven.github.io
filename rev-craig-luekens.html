                <h2>Senior Pastor</h2>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Craig was born and raised in Indianapolis, IN, and was
                    brought up in the Jewish faith through high school. In
                    college - at Indiana University - he began asking deeper,
                    more existential questions about purpose, meaning, and the
                    existence of God. At the start of Sophomore year he
                    committed his life to Christ. Having become convinced of the
                    truth of Scripture, the Spirit convicted him that Jesus
                    alone demands and deserves everything. In hopes of pursuing
                    an academic career, he attended Yale Divinity School,
                    completing a MDiv in 2008. God drew him to Christ
                    Presbyterian Church and eventually to the ministry through
                    CPC, where he also began work with Athletes in Action at
                    Yale, a sports ministry for undergrad student-athletes.
                    Craig was ordained as a Teaching Elder in the PCA in 2012
                    and completed a ThM in 2014 at Gordon Conwell Theological
                    Seminary in Biblical Theology.

                <p class="body-text">
                    Having begun his role as Senior Pastor in 2023, his primary
                    responsibilities include preaching, teaching, pastoral
                    counseling, and moderating the Session/WLB (Shepherd
                    Leaders) and Servant Leadership Boards.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Craig has three kids - Charlotte (b. 2009); Julian (b.
                    2011); and Eli (b.2014) - from a previous marriage. He and
                    Allison were married in 2021.

                    Craig was a semi-professional cyclist before pursuing the
                    ministry and always seeks more ways to merge his two loves
                    as much as he can - discussing a good book on a good ride.
