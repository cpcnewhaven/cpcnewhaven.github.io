                        <p>
                            People often tell us that they've found CPC to be a
                            very
                            friendly place, but more than friendly, it is often
                            talked
                            about as a "safe" place where people can be
                            "in route" no
                            matter what the location of your spiritual journey.
                            The
                            spirituality of CPC is very much about grace as this
                            not
                            only makes it okay to be morally flawed and/or
                            broken in
                            some way, but expected even. There will be people
                            there that
                            are not yet Christians, people who are Christians
                            and left
                            the church and are venturing back into the church,
                            and even
                            people who have been going to church for a long time
                            but are
                            finding that the closer they get to God the more
                            they see
                            how flawed they are in comparison, and how much more
                            loved
                            and accepted than they ever expected possible
                            because of
                            what Christ accomplishes for us. So come as you are,
                            both
                            outwardly and inwardly, and let happen what happens.
                            It is
                            safe!

                            We love our children and enjoy having them in
                            worship. That

                            during the service are getting "antsy" or are
                            distracting
                            their parents from worship. It is intentionally a
                            "free time" for guided play to allow children to
                            release
                            some energy before they rejoin their parents after

                            sermon. The booklet

                            explains our philosophy of children in relation to
                            worshiping together with some very practical ways to
                            help
