                <h2>Assistant Pastor</h2>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Jerry was born in Pasadena, California. At nine years of age
                    he and his family moved to Savannah Georgia where he spent
                    the majority of his formative years. Being a high school
                    football player offered him the opportunity to play at the
                    college level at Trinity International in Deerfield,
                    Illinois. After several injuries the Lord providentially
                    took away the desire to play football and replaced it with a
                    desire for ministry.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    After years of wrestling with whether or not he should
                    pursue vocational ministry the Lord sent him to Reformed
                    Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi to pursue a
                    Masters of Divinity. During his four years of training he
                    spent the summer of 2018 interning at Christ Presbyterian
                    Church. This eventually, in God's providence, turned into a
                    call to serve as an Assistant Pastor as well as starting a
                    college ministry at Southern Connecticut State University.
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Some of his passions are: traveling, spending time in nature
                    such as hiking, kayaking and camping. Reading fiction and
                    non-fiction, theology, philosophy, apologetics and science
                    books are a joy and a delight to him. Using these various
                    genres, along with sports and nature are tools he uses to
                    disciple and point people to Jesus Christ.
