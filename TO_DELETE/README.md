- `src/js/fetch-highlights-display-homepage.js` - Old script replaced by highlights.js (only still referenced in old/workshop files)

## Before Deleting:

1. **Verify no active pages reference these files** - Check for any broken links
2. **Check git history** - Ensure nothing critical is in these files
3. **Test the website** - Make sure everything still works after moving these files
4. **Keep this folder for a period** (suggest 30-90 days) before permanent deletion
5. **Check for any API endpoints or build processes** that might reference these paths

## Files Kept (were in workshop but still referenced):
- `a-c-c.html` - Moved to root directory as it's referenced in resources.html and data/resources.json

## Restoration:
If any of these files are needed, simply move them back from this directory to their original locations.
