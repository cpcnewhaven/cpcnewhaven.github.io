                    <p>The primary and first level of mercy assistance begins at the small group level where needs are most readily discerned and the individual dynamics understood in coordination with the small group coordinator. When assistance exceeds the ability of the small group, then the small group coordinator contacts the CPC Mercy coordinator who will consult with the Sr. Pastor and develop a plan for addressing the need. In the case of financial assistance, this application should be filled out and returned to our administrator. Or you may submit the application through an online form <a href="https://cpcnewhaven.ccbchurch.com/goto/forms/mercy-fund-application">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>As the body of Christ, we desire to support members during major life transitions or events in ways consistent with being the family of God. Showering members with prayer in contexts of communal celebrations or grieving can be a great blessing, witness, and support to members in a way that makes tangible Christ's promise "I will never leave you nor forsake you" (Heb.13:5). During Christ's ascension ministry, we know that this promise is no less true given Christ's presence as mediated through the body of Christ on earth that renders the words of Christ in Matthew just prior to his ascension all the more realistic, "Behold, I am with you until the end of the age" (Mt 28:20).
