    "Description": "<p><strong>Compline Homily | 9.22.21</strong></p><p>Beginning centuries ago, monastic communities gathered in the evening to “complete” the day by observing a worship service that weaves together songs, prayers, Scriptural reflections, and Communion. In that spirit, we hope to enter God’s presence with others from around our city to experience Compline. Each night we will celebrate the central Christian feast of the Lord’s Table. All are welcome to join us in the middle of the week as we take refuge in the riches of God’s grace in Christ.</p><p>Compline meets Wednesday at 8:00pm during the academic year from 9/22/21 - 12/8/21 (except Thanksgiving week on 11/24/21) and 1/19/22 - 4/6/22. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/163570349189594\">Invite and share on Facebook here.</a></p><p>Compline meets in-person at CPC (135 Whitney Ave., New Haven) or you may watch via live stream. Access links to join and the bulletin <a href=\"https://www.cpcnewhaven.org/live\">here</a>.</p><p>‍</p>",

    "Passage": "<p id=\"\">1On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.2Jesusalso was invited to the wedding with his disciples.3 When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesussaid to him, “They have no wine.”4 And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this have to do withme? My hour has not yet come.”5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”6 Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twentyor thirty gallons.7Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to thebrim.8 And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.” So theytook it.9 When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not knowwhere it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feastcalled the bridegroom 10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when peoplehave drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”11 This, the firstof his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.12 After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, andthey stayed there for a few days.</p>",

The sheep hear his voice, and hecalls his own sheep by name and leads them out.4 When he has brought out all his own, hegoes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.5 A stranger they willnot follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”6 Thisfigure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying tothem.7 So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.8 All whocame before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.9I am thedoor. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.10The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and haveit abundantly.11I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for thesheep.</strong></p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

    "Passage": "<p id=\"\">35 The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.38Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?”And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”39 He said to them,“Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.40 One of the two who heard John speak and followedJesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him,“We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”44 NowPhilip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him,“We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth,the son of Joseph.”46 Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”47Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, anIsraelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”49Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”50Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</p>",

The friend ofthe bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.\" 31 Hewho comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaksin an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. 32 He bears witness to what hehas seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. 33 Whoever receives his testimonysets his seal to this, that God is true. 34 For he whom God has sent utters the words of God,for he gives the Spirit without measure. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all thingsinto his hand. 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey theSon shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

    "Passage": "<p id=\"\">23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they sawthe signs that he was doing. 24 But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because heknew all people 25 and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was inman.\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 2 This man came toJesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no onecan do these signs that you do unless God is with him.” 3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say toyou, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “Howcan a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and beborn?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, hecannot enter the kingdom of God. 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born ofthe Spirit is spirit. 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ 8 The wind blowswhere it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where itgoes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">9 Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” 10 Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher ofIsrael and yet you do not understand these things? 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what weknow, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. 12 If I havetold you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. 14 Andas Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 thatwhoever believes in him may have eternal life. 16 \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his onlySon, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not sendhis Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved throughhim. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemnedalready, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darknessrather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hatesthe light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever doeswhat is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried outin God.\"</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

    "Passage": "<p id=\"\">1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making andbaptizing more disciples than John 2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only hisdisciples), 3 he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. 4 And he had to pass throughSamaria. 5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob hadgiven to his son Joseph. 6 Jacob’s well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from hisjourney, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” 8 (For hisdisciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) 9 The Samaritan woman said to him,“How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have nodealings with Samaritans.) 10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it isthat is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would havegiven you living water.” 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw waterwith, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? 12 Are you greater than ourfather Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and hislivestock.” 13 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,14 butwhoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that Iwill give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” 15 The womansaid to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here todraw water.”</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">16 Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” 17 The woman answered him, “Ihave no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; 18 for youhave had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you havesaid is true.” 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathersworshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people oughtto worship.” 21 Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither onthis mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 22 You worship what you do notknow; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming,and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, forthe Father is seeking such people to worship him. 24 God is spirit, and those who worshiphim must worship in spirit and truth.” 25 The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is</p><p id=\"\">\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\tcoming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” 26 Jesus said toher, “I who speak to you am he.”\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">27 Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, butno one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?” 28 So the woman lefther water jar and went away into town and said to the people, 29 “Come, see a man whotold me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” 30 They went out of the town and werecoming to him.</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said to them, “Ihave food to eat that you do not know about.” 33 So the disciples said to one another, “Hasanyone brought him something to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will ofhim who sent me and to accomplish his work. 35 Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months,then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are whitefor harvest. 36 Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternallife, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. 37 For here the saying holds true, ‘Onesows and another reaps.’ 38 I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others havelabored, and you have entered into their labor.”</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">39 Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “Hetold me all that I ever did.” 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to staywith them, and he stayed there two days. 41 And many more believed because of his word.42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, forwe have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t\t</p><p id=\"\">\t\t</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you theProphet?\" And he answered, \"No.\"22 So they said to him, \"Who are you? We need to give ananswer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"23 He said, \"I am the voiceof one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophetIsaiah said.\"24(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)25 They asked him, \"Then whyare you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\"26Johnanswered them, \"I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,27 evenhe who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.\"28 Thesethings took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.29 The next dayhe saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away thesin of the world!30 This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me,because he was before me.'31I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I camebaptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.\"32 And John bore witness: \"I sawthe Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.33I myself did notknow him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see theSpirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'34 And I have seenand have borne witness that this is the Son of God.\"</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",
