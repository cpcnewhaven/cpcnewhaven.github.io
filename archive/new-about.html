            <p class="about-body-text">
              We want this to be all about Christ—his work, not ours, as the
              basis of our relationship to God and one another, and his glory,
              not ours or any popular leader, as the object of our ultimate
              affection and respect. It is our desire to experience total
              Christ, not just one or another brand of Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              The term "Total Christ" originates from the 5th-century
              pastor-theologian St. Augustine, who described the relationship of
              Christ's incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension
              ministry (present) as
              "the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made total Christ, both head and body."
            </p>

            <h3>The Five Marks</h3>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <strong>1. Gospel-Centered:</strong> Trust in the gospel motivates
              us to be humble because we know Christ's work to us is purely a
              gift, but also boldly confident in the face of shame and sin
              because it's based in God's power! This grounds us in God's
              finished work on the cross, where he forgave our sins and
              reconciled us to himself. Everything we do is motivated from and
              by the gospel.
              <strong>Think: Humble, honest, authentic, gracious, safe, desire
                to be truly known and loved by God and others</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <strong>2. Missional: </strong> More (though not less!) than being
              evangelistic, we strive to be missional because God promises to
              dwell with His people in all their God-given cultures, languages,
              and demographics through the church. This grounds us in God's
              global presence, where the church is the evangelist for a whole
              new way of life, showing the world who Jesus is and what it means
              to follow Him in all our relationships.
              <strong>Think: Culturally self-aware, open & inviting, purposeful,
                holistic evangelismsafe</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <strong>3. Confessional - Christ as our Prophet: </strong>We are
              not the first ones to consider what church should be (thank God!).
              We humbly submit to God's revelation in the Word as it has been
              historically interpreted, seeking to be united in belief across
              generations and cultures. Officially, we subscribe to the
              documents of Westminster (c.1630) as the summary of our faith.
              This grounds us in Christ as our Prophet who still speaks.
              <strong>Think: doctrine that is alive and an unwillingness to be
                distracted by cultural fads</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <strong>4. Sacramental - Christ as our Priest: </strong> We desire
              an emphasis on sacramental spirituality wherein Christ our Priest
              is "fleshed out" in a carefully designed four movement worship
              service that follows the four movements of the gospel and
              culminates every week in a participation in eucharistic communion
              with Christ as "fleshed out" in cultural styles specific to each
              local community (1 Cor. 10:14-17, Heb. 12:22-24, Rev. 4-5)!
              <strong>Think: Friendly, worshipful, mysterious</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <strong>5. Communal - Christ as our King:</strong>Christ did not
              leave us as orphans, but joined us with Himself to the church, so
              to be a Christian is to be a part of the redeemed community. Many
              of us experience Christ first through the love of his body. We
              also take church government as an instrument of mercy seriously.
              This grounds us in Christ as our King.
              <strong>Think: loving, humble, one-anotherings</strong>

            <h1 class="about-heading">Our Commitments</h1>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              We seek to be radically grounded in the good news that though we
              are more sinful than we may ever dare to believe, we are more
              loved in Christ than we can ever dare to hope. A community united
              in the love of Jesus changes lives and communities. We hope that
              Sunday worship is the touchstone of our lives and that it bleeds
              into how we treat each other inside and outside of the church.
              Many of us didn't grow up Presbyterian - or even Christian - so
              please feel comfortable coming with lots of questions. We hope to
              be a community that knows we are all in need of God's mercy and
              have the privilege to embody it in the church.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Five Basic Commitments</h3>
            <p class="about-body-text">
              <b>1.</b><strong> Scripture - We are committed to the Old and New
                Testament Scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice.
              </strong> While believing that God powerfully manifests his
              infinite glory in a general way through creation, our Christian
              faith and practice is grounded in God's works of redemption in
              history as explained to us through the divinely appointed means of
              inspired Scripture. We believe that all things necessary for
              salvation are sufficiently revealed to us by the Holy Spirit
              speaking through the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments. It
              is, therefore, our ambition to teach the whole counsel of God's
              word, not adding to, or subtracting from, anything contained
              within it, recognizing no other source for divine revelation,
              whether by ecclesiastical traditions or private revelations.
              <br><br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong> To liberate all of us
              from oppressive, human-made opinions and guard the gracious gospel
              against manipulation and self-serving abuses. We want the God of
              grace and glory to be our only Lord.
